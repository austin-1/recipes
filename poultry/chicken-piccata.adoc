== Ingredients

* 1.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded to 1/2” thickness (or purchased thin-sliced)
* Sea salt and black pepper, to taste
* 3 tablespoons blanched almond flour
* 2 tablespoons tapioca flour
* 3 tablespoons ghee, divided
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small onion, chopped (about 1/2 cup)
* 1 cup chicken bone broth
* Juice of 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)
* 1/3 cup coconut cream, unsweetened, blended before using
* 1 1/2 teaspoons stone ground mustard or Dijon mustard (optional)
* 1/4 cup capers, drained

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * If necessary, pound the chicken breasts to 1/2” thickness and cut into cutlets. Season with sea salt and pepper on both sides.

2. **Dredge and Cook the Chicken:**
   * Heat a large skillet over medium/medium-high heat. In a shallow bowl, mix together the almond flour and tapioca flour for dredging.
   * Add 2 tablespoons of ghee to the skillet. Once the ghee is heated, lightly dredge each chicken cutlet in the flour mixture, shaking off the excess, and place in the skillet.
   * Cook for about 4 minutes on each side until the chicken is cooked through and the outside is golden brown. Adjust the heat as necessary to avoid over-browning. Remove the chicken to a plate and set aside.

3. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   * Lower the heat to medium-low and add the remaining tablespoon of ghee. Add the chopped onions and cook for about a minute until translucent, then add the minced garlic. Cook and stir for another minute until softened.
   * Add the chicken bone broth and lemon juice, then raise the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a boil, stirring occasionally.
   * Cook for about 3 minutes, then stir in the coconut cream and mustard (if using). Continue to cook and stir for another minute, then stir in the drained capers.

4. **Finish the Dish:**
   * Add the cooked chicken cutlets back to the skillet, lower the heat to a simmer, and let it simmer for another minute until heated through.
   * Serve the chicken and sauce over sautéed cauliflower rice or veggie noodles. Enjoy!
