=== Step 2: Cook the Lentils
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a heavy-bottom pot or Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
3. Add the diced onions, diced carrots, minced garlic, and minced ginger.
4. Sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 5–7 minutes.

6. Add the lentils, diced tomatoes, salt, and water. Stir to combine.
7. Bring the mixture to a boil, then cover and reduce the heat to low.

=== Step 3: Prepare the Chicken
1. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels.
2. Season all sides of the chicken with kosher salt and ground black pepper.
3. Generously rub each piece with 2–3 tablespoons of Berbere Spice Mix.

=== Step 4: Cook the Chicken
1. Heat a heavy-bottom skillet over medium-high heat and add a little olive oil.
2. Place the chicken thighs skin-side down in the skillet.
3. Sear the chicken until the skin is crispy and golden, about 6–8 minutes.
4. Turn the chicken thighs over and reduce the heat to medium. Sear for an additional 2–3 minutes.
