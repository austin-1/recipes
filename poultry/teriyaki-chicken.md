## Ingredients

### Chicken Teriyaki
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1/4 cup honey
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons sake (Japanese rice wine)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon grated peeled fresh ginger
- 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), cut into 8 pieces
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- Coarse salt and ground black pepper

### Roasted Scallions
- 4 bunches scallions, greens cut into 2 1/2-inch pieces, whites halved lengthwise
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with racks in the upper and lower thirds.

2. **Prepare the Teriyaki Sauce:** In a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, mirin, sake, garlic, and ginger. Divide the sauce between two bowls; one for basting and the other reserved for serving.

3. **Bake the Chicken:** Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet and brush with sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper. Baste with the prepared teriyaki sauce from the first bowl. Bake on the upper rack for 20 minutes, basting twice with pan juices.

4. **Finish Cooking the Chicken:** Transfer the chicken to the lower rack and baste once more with the teriyaki sauce. Continue to cook until a thermometer inserted into a breast (avoiding bone) registers 165°F (74°C), about 5 to 10 minutes.

5. **Roast the Scallions:** Meanwhile, on another rimmed baking sheet, toss the scallions with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on the upper rack until crisp-tender and slightly caramelized, about 10 to 12 minutes. If desired, sprinkle with sesame seeds for added texture and flavor.

6. **Serve:** Serve the chicken with the roasted scallions and drizzle with the reserved teriyaki sauce. Garnish with sesame seeds if using.

Enjoy this refined take on a classic teriyaki chicken, infused with the subtle complexities of Kumamoto cuisine!
