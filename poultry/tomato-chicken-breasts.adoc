* 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 cup onions, chopped
* 1 tablespoon garlic cloves, chopped
* 2 (400g) cans chopped tomatoes
* 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
* 1 cup carrots, chopped
* 1/2 tablespoon chicken stock powder
* 1/2 tablespoon Herbs de Provence
* 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce

== Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   * Preheat your oven to 180°C (365°F).

2. **Season the Chicken:**
   * Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika.

3. **Sear the Chicken:**
   * Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear the seasoned chicken breasts on both sides for about 3 minutes each until golden brown. Remove the chicken breasts from the pan and transfer to a plate.

4. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   * Add butter to the hot Dutch oven and melt it. Add the chopped onions, carrots, and mushrooms, and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped garlic and cook for another minute.

5. **Make the Tomato Sauce:**
   * Pour the chopped tomatoes and Worcestershire sauce into the Dutch oven with the vegetables and stir to combine. Season with Herbs de Provence, chicken stock powder, salt, and black pepper. Stir everything together.

6. **Bake the Chicken:**
   * Nestle the seared chicken breasts into the tomato sauce. Spoon some of the sauce over the chicken breasts. Cover the Dutch oven with its lid.
   * Place the Dutch oven in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the chicken breast registers 165°F (74°C).

7. **Serve:**
   * Remove the Dutch oven from the oven. Serve the chicken and tomato sauce with rice, potatoes, or pasta. Enjoy!
