== Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, pounded 1/4-inch thick (or chicken tenderloins)
* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 3/4 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
* 1 (8-ounce) package pre-sliced bella or button mushrooms
* 3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots (from 1 medium shallot)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2/3 cup chicken broth
* 2/3 cup dry Marsala wine
* 2/3 cup heavy cream
* 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley, for serving (optional)

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * In a ziplock bag, combine the flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
   * Add the chicken to the bag, seal tightly, and shake to coat the chicken evenly. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
   * Heat the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
   * Place the flour-dusted chicken in the pan, shaking off any excess first, and cook, turning once, until the chicken is golden and just barely cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes total.
   * Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.

3. **Cook the Mushrooms and Aromatics:**
   * In the same pan, melt the remaining tablespoon of butter.
   * Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
   * Add the shallots, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt; cook for 1 to 2 minutes more.

4. **Make the Sauce:**
   * Add the chicken broth, Marsala wine, heavy cream, thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper to the pan.
   * Use a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan into the liquid.
   * Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium and gently boil, uncovered, until the sauce is reduced by about half, slightly thickened, and darkened in color, 10 to 15 minutes.

5. **Finish the Dish:**
   * Add the chicken back to the pan, along with any juices that accumulated on the plate.
   * Reduce the heat to low and simmer until the chicken is warmed through and the sauce thickens a bit more, 2 to 3 minutes.
   * Sprinkle with parsley, if using, and serve.

== Notes

* If your chicken breasts are large (about 3/4 lb. each), itâ€™s best to first cut them horizontally to form four flat fillets, then pound them to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Alternatively, you could pound them thin first and then cut them in half vertically.
