Rosemary roasted whole chicken is a simple, delicious meal, perfect for family dinners or special occasions. This recipe showcases the ease of oven roasting and leverages the aromatic richness of rosemary and garlic, adapted from a traditional French technique.

== Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (lemon peel reserved)
* 1/4 cup + extra olive oil for roasting rack
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* Pepper to taste
* 1 whole chicken (3 to 4 lbs)

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place the roasting rack on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan and brush the rack with oil. Set aside.
. In a small bowl, mix together the rosemary, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
. Remove any giblets or bag of "parts" that may be inside the chicken. Reserve for another use or discard.
. Place the chicken on the prepared rack with the breast side down. Brush a little less than half of the oil mixture on the top and sides of the chicken. Turn the chicken over so the breast side is up. Pour a bit of the olive oil mixture inside the cavity and brush the remaining oil on the top and sides. Place the reserved lemon peel inside the cavity.
. Put the chicken in the oven and add 2 to 3 cups of water to the bottom of the roasting pan or baking sheet. Roast the chicken for 45 minutes to an hour, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 170 degrees F.
. Let the chicken cool before carving. Serve as desired, or use the chicken for other dishes.
. Optionally, make overnight chicken stock in your slow cooker with the bones.
