== Ingredients

* 4 lbs. chicken cutlets
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* ~1 cup arrowroot flour
* 2-8 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

=== For The Sauce:
* 2 lemons
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 1/2 - 3 cups chicken broth
* 2 tablespoons arrowroot flour
* 2-3 tablespoons capers, drained

== Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven:**
   * Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C).

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * If not pre-cut, butterfly the chicken breasts to create cutlets. Cut the butterflied cutlets in half lengthwise so they are no longer attached.
   * Season both sides of the chicken cutlets with salt and pepper.
   * Place 1/2 cup of arrowroot flour in a bowl. Lightly dredge both sides of the cutlets in the arrowroot flour to coat them. If needed, add more flour to ensure all cutlets are coated.

3. **Brown the Chicken:**
   * In a Dutch oven or large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
   * Working in batches, lightly brown both sides of the cutlets (about 3 minutes per side). Set the browned cutlets on a plate. They do not need to be fully cooked at this stage.
   * If the skillet becomes dry, add another tablespoon of olive oil as needed to keep the bottom coated.

4. **Make the Sauce:**
   * Reduce the heat to medium-low in the same skillet or Dutch oven. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds, being careful not to burn.
   * Pour 2 cups of chicken broth into the skillet, whisking constantly to scrape up the brown bits from the bottom.
   * In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup of broth with 2 tablespoons of arrowroot flour and the juice of 1 lemon. Pour this mixture into the skillet and whisk until the sauce begins to thicken, about 3 minutes.
   * Add the drained capers to the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add another 1/2 cup of broth.

5. **Bake the Chicken:**
   * Nestle the browned chicken cutlets into the sauce.
   * Cover the Dutch oven and bake in the preheated oven for 2 hours.

6. **Serve:**
   * Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and let the dish cool for 10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken slightly.
   * Garnish with finely chopped parsley and thinly sliced lemon rounds before serving.

== Notes

* For a slow cooker version, pour the sauce and capers into a Crockpot and nestle the chicken in. Cook on Low for 4 hours.
