This Chicken Florentine recipe features perfectly seared chicken breasts in a thick and creamy spinach sauce. It's a versatile dish that can be served with pasta, rice, or a simple green salad. A splash of lemon and a sprinkle of parsley add extra flavor and color.

== Ingredients

=== Chicken Dredge:
* 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, finely shredded
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

=== Florentine Sauce:
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 cups white wine, or chicken broth
* 1 cup half and half
* 1/3 cup softened cream cheese
* 3 cups fresh spinach
* 1/2 fresh lemon or 1.5 tablespoons lemon juice (optional)
* Fresh parsley, to garnish

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Place plastic wrap over each chicken breast and use a meat tenderizer to pound it until it’s about an inch thick and of equal thickness throughout. Pat dry.
   * Combine the chicken dredge ingredients in a shallow dish. Coat the chicken in the flour mixture, tapping off any excess.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
   * Melt the butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
   * Add the chicken and cover the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes per side, until golden. If needed, sear in two separate batches. Set the chicken aside on a plate once cooked, ensuring the internal temperature reaches 165°F.

3. **Make the Florentine Sauce:**
   * Decrease the heat to medium and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1 minute.
   * Add the white wine to deglaze the pan, using a silicone spatula to scrape up any brown bits from the bottom. Increase the heat slightly and allow it to gently bubble until the liquid is reduced by half, about 5 minutes.
   * Temper the half and half by heating it in the microwave for 40 seconds. Gradually add it to the skillet, stirring as you do so. Bring it to a gentle bubble, then reduce the heat to low.
   * Stir in the softened cream cheese until smooth and combined.
   * Add the spinach and cook until it’s soft and wilted. Add lemon juice if desired.

4. **Combine and Serve:**
   * Return the chicken and any drippings back to the pan. Cover and heat through. Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve.
