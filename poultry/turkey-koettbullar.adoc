Turkey Köttbullar, a lighter take on the traditional Swedish meatballs, features tender turkey meatballs seasoned with warm spices and served in a rich, creamy gravy. This dish is perfect for a cozy meal, especially when paired with mashed potatoes or lingonberry jam.

== Ingredients
*Meatballs:*
* 1 pound ground turkey
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup milk
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 2 tablespoons butter (for frying)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil (for frying)

*Gravy:*
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 2 cups beef or chicken broth
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* Salt and pepper, to taste

== Instructions
. *Prepare the Meatball Mixture:*
.. In a large bowl, combine the breadcrumbs and milk. Let sit for 5 minutes until the breadcrumbs absorb the milk.
.. Add the ground turkey, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, beaten egg, salt, black pepper, ground allspice, and ground nutmeg to the breadcrumb mixture. Mix until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a little more breadcrumbs.
. *Form the Meatballs:*
.. Using your hands or a small scoop, form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet or plate.
. *Cook the Meatballs:*
.. Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the meatballs in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
.. Fry the meatballs, turning occasionally, until they are browned on all sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. Remove the meatballs from the skillet and set aside.
. *Make the Gravy:*
.. In the same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and whisk continuously for about 1-2 minutes until the mixture turns golden brown.
.. Gradually add the beef or chicken broth, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Stir in the heavy cream and soy sauce, and bring the mixture to a simmer.
.. Cook the gravy until it thickens, about 5-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
. *Combine and Serve:*
.. Return the meatballs to the skillet with the gravy. Gently toss the meatballs in the gravy to coat them evenly. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the meatballs are heated through.
. *Serve:*
.. Serve the Turkey Köttbullar hot, garnished with chopped parsley if desired. Traditionally served with mashed potatoes or lingonberry jam.
