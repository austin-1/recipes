== Instructions
. *Prepare the Duck Legs:*
.. Preheat the oven to 180째C (160째C fan) / gas mark 4.
.. Season the duck legs with salt and pepper.
.. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the duck legs skin-side down until well browned, then flip to brown the other side.
.. Remove from heat, drain most of the fat, and lay orange slices in a ceramic baking dish. Place duck legs on top.
. *Prepare the Vegetables and Sauce:*
.. Return the pan to the heat. Add chopped shallots, celery, and carrot. Fry for 4 minutes.

.. Bake for 1 hour.
. *Add Whole Shallots:*
.. Melt half the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Brown the whole shallots.
.. After the duck has baked for 1 hour, add browned shallots to the dish. Cook for another 30 minutes until the duck and shallots are tender.
.. Transfer the duck legs and whole shallots to a separate dish.
.. Strain the cooking liquid into a jug, removing any fat or vegetable debris.
. *Finish the Dish:*
.. Increase oven temperature to 200째C (180째C fan) / gas mark 6.
.. Return duck legs to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes to crisp.
.. Meanwhile, reduce the strained cooking liquid in a pan until about 300ml remains.
