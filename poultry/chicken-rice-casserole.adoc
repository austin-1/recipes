This Herbed Chicken and Rice Casserole is a hearty and flavorful dish made with marinated chicken thighs, pancetta, cauliflower rice, and fresh herbs. It's baked to perfection in a Dutch oven for a comforting meal.

== Ingredients

=== Chicken Marinade:
* 1 lb boneless chicken thighs, cut into 1-by-2-inch pieces
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend
* 1 tablespoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon sea salt
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil

=== Casserole:
* 2 tablespoons avocado oil
* 1/2 cup diced pancetta
* 1/2 medium onion, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 8 cups cauliflower rice (fresh or frozen)
* 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried)
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried)
* 1 cup chicken bone broth
* Sea salt, as needed

== Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   * In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken thighs with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, sea salt, and avocado oil. Mix well to coat the chicken pieces evenly. Set aside for 10-15 minutes to marinate.

2. **Cook the Casserole:**
   * Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   * Heat a medium-sized cast iron pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and add the avocado oil.
   * Once the oil is hot, brown the marinated chicken pieces for 2-3 minutes on each side. Work in batches if necessary. Transfer the browned chicken to a separate dish.
   * In the same pot, add the diced pancetta and cook until crispy and browned.
   * Add the chopped onions and celery, stirring and cooking until they soften.
   * Add the cauliflower rice, chopped rosemary, thyme, and chicken bone broth. Stir in the partially cooked chicken pieces, mixing everything well.
   * Cover the pot and place it in the preheated oven. Bake for 30 minutes, uncovering for the last 5 minutes to allow any excess liquid to evaporate.

3. **Serve:**
   * Remove from the oven and serve the Herbed Chicken and Rice Casserole hot, garnished with additional fresh herbs if desired.
