== Ingredients
* 4 duck legs
* 1/4 cup sherry cooking wine or mirin
* 2 cups low sodium chicken stock
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
* 3 slices ginger
* 3 cloves garlic, sliced
* 10-12 scallions, cut into 2-inch lengths
* Optional: 1 star anise, 1 bay leaf

== Instructions
. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
. Rinse the duck legs and trim off any excess fat. Pat dry with paper towels.
. Heat a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the duck legs, skin side down, and cook over medium-low heat until the skin is evenly golden brown. Do not move the legs until they are properly seared.
. Flip the duck legs and sear on the other side for 1 minute.
. Remove the duck legs from the pot and pour off the excess fat, saving it for other cooking uses.
. Add the Shaoxing wine, chicken stock, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, white pepper, ginger, garlic, and scallions to the pot. Include the star anise and bay leaf if using.
. Return the duck legs to the pot, skin side up, making sure the liquid comes halfway up the legs but does not cover them.
. Bring the liquid to a simmer and transfer the pot to the oven. Cook for 30 minutes uncovered.
. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue to cook for another 30 minutes, or until the duck is tender.
. Serve the duck with the braising liquid as a sauce (use a fat separator to remove excess fat), alongside steamed rice and sautéed greens.
