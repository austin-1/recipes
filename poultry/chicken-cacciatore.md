- 3 16 oz. cans crushed tomatoes
- 4 teaspoons dried thyme
- 4 teaspoons dried rosemary

- 1/2 cup dry red wine
- 1/4 cup capers, drained (for a Sicilian twist)
- 1/2 cup green olives, pitted and sliced (for additional flavor)

## Preparation

### Chicken Cacciatore
1. Preheat oven to 300Â°F. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Season chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Place chicken in the pan, skin-side down, and cook until golden brown. Turn chicken and cook until browned on the underside. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.
   
2. Add pancetta to the pan and cook until crisp. Remove and set aside with the chicken.

3. In the same pan, add diced yellow onions, celery, carrot, and bell peppers. Cook until vegetables are softened, adding more olive oil if necessary. Add chopped garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking for an additional minute.

4. Pour in the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom. Allow the wine to reduce slightly.

5. Add the crushed tomatoes, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried oregano, cremini mushrooms, pancetta, chicken, capers, and green olives to the pot. Stir to combine all the ingredients well.

6. Add the bay leaf, cover the Dutch oven, and braise in the oven until the chicken is tender, about 2 hours.

### Onion Garnish
1. Heat olive oil in a pan over high heat. Add the quartered yellow onions and sear until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper.

2. Add the thyme sprig and white wine to the pan. Cover and reduce until the sauce has thickened and the onions are tender.

### To Plate
Serve the Chicken Cacciatore alongside black Tuscan rice and the onion garnish. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.
