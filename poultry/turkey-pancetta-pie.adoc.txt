== Ingredients
*Pastry:*
* 400g plain flour
* 200g unsalted butter (cubed, cold)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 90-100ml ice cold water

*Filling:*
* 30g unsalted butter
* 30ml olive oil
* 3 turkey escalopes or chicken breasts (approx. 420g)
* 130g pancetta cubes or diced smoky bacon
* 1 red onion, diced
* 30g plain flour
* 250ml chicken stock
* 100ml milk
* 2 dessertspoons mascarpone or cream cheese
* 2 teaspoons fresh tarragon, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed

== Directions
. *Make the Pastry:*
.. Add cold butter to flour and rub together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the salt.
.. Gradually add cold water, a tablespoon at a time, just enough to form a smooth but not sticky dough. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for 1 hour.
. *Make the Filling:*
.. Melt butter in a large frying pan and add olive oil.
.. Add the pancetta and cook for a minute or two to allow the fat to render. Add the turkey breast and cook until browned.
.. Remove the turkey and pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside.
.. Add the diced onion to the pan and cook until softened, then stir in the crushed garlic.
.. Sprinkle the plain flour over the onions and garlic. Stir and cook for a minute or two to eliminate the raw flour taste.
.. Slowly add the chicken stock, stirring well to remove any lumps, then add the milk.
.. Stir in the mascarpone or cream cheese until well blended.
.. Add the chopped tarragon, then return the turkey and pancetta to the pan. Allow the filling to cool slightly while preparing the pastry case.
. *Assemble the Pie:*
.. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry and line a greased tart tin. Trim off any excess pastry, leaving it slightly over the edge for crimping.
.. Once the filling has cooled, place it into the pie shell. Roll out the remaining third of the pastry and cover the pie.
.. Trim any excess pastry, crimp the edges to seal, and brush the top with a little egg wash.
.. Cut two slits in the top of the pastry to allow steam to escape during cooking.
.. Bake in the center of the oven at Gas mark 5 / 190°C / 375°F for 50 minutes. Check after 30 minutes and cover the edges with greaseproof paper if they are browning too quickly.
. *Serve:*
.. Serve the pie hot with creamy mash and fresh green vegetables.
