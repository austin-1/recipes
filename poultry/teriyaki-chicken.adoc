link:./README.me[&larrhk; Back to Poultry Recipes]

Sweet and sticky, this Teriyaki Chicken dish combines kid-friendliness with a touch of sophistication. Roasted scallions, a staple in Japanese cooking, add a mellow flavor that complements the chicken perfectly.

== Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1/2 cup honey
* 1 garlic clove, minced
* 1 teaspoon grated peeled fresh ginger
* 1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), cut into 8 pieces
* 4 bunches scallions, greens cut into 2 1/2-inch pieces, whites halved lengthwise
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (such as safflower)
* Coarse salt and ground pepper

== Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450째F (230째C) with racks in the upper and lower thirds.
2. In a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, garlic, and ginger. Divide the sauce between two bowls; one for basting and the other reserved for serving.
3. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place the chicken pieces on the sheet and baste with the prepared sauce from the first bowl. Bake on the upper rack for 20 minutes, basting twice with pan juices.
4. Transfer the chicken to the lower rack and baste once more. Continue to cook until a thermometer inserted into a breast (avoiding bone) registers 165째F (74째C), about 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, on another rimmed baking sheet, toss the scallions with vegetable oil; season with salt and pepper. Roast on the upper rack until crisp-tender, about 10 to 12 minutes.
6. Serve the chicken with the roasted scallions and the reserved sauce.
