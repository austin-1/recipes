== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Rinse the chicken drumsticks under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels.
   * Season the chicken drumsticks with salt and freshly ground black pepper on all sides.

2. **Sear the Chicken:**
   * In a large Dutch oven, heat 4 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat.
   * Add the seasoned chicken drumsticks to the Dutch oven.
   * Sear the chicken on all sides until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside.

3. **Cook the Aromatics:**
   * In the same Dutch oven, add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
   * Add the finely chopped garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.

4. **Add Vegetables and Chicken:**
   * Add the red bell peppers, chopped Roma tomatoes, and Spanish olives to the Dutch oven.
   * Stir in the fresh thyme, chopped cilantro, water, and granulated chicken bouillon.
   * Return the seared chicken drumsticks to the Dutch oven and stir to combine all ingredients.

5. **Stew the Chicken:**
   * Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat.
   * Once boiling, cover the Dutch oven and reduce the heat to medium-low.
   * Cook for about 1 hour, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.

6. **Shred the Chicken:**
   * After 1 hour, check the chicken for tenderness. It should be very tender and easy to pull apart.
   * Remove the chicken drumsticks from the Dutch oven and place them on a cutting board.
   * Using two forks, shred the chicken meat off the bones. Discard the bones and return the shredded chicken to the pot.

7. **Adjust Seasoning:**
   * Stir the shredded chicken into the stew and taste for seasoning.
   * Adjust the salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.

8. **Serve:**
