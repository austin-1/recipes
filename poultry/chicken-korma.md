## Instructions

1. Blend the ginger, garlic, and 3 tablespoons of water in an electric blender until you have a smooth paste.
2. Heat the oil in a wide frying pan or sauté pan over high heat. When the oil is very hot, add the bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seeds. Stir once or twice.

7. Remove the cover, add the cream, and cook on high heat for another 7 to 8 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened. Stir gently.
8. Serve hot with rice or naan.
