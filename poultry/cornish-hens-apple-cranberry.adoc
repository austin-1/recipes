== Instructions
. *Make the Stuffing:*
.. Melt butter in a skillet until foaming subsides. Add onions and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
.. Add pecans, sage, thyme, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook for 3 minutes until pecans are fragrant.
.. Deglaze the pan with a splash of apple cider, scraping any browned bits from the bottom.
.. Remove from heat and stir in cooked rice, apples, cranberries, and parsley. Season with additional salt and pepper as needed. Set aside.
. *Make the Glaze:*
.. Combine apple cider and maple syrup in a pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the mixture is syrupy, about 15 minutes.
.. Whisk in Dijon mustard and cinnamon. Set aside.
. *Stuff and Roast the Hens:*
.. Remove hens from refrigerator 30 minutes before roasting. Clean, rinse, and pat dry.
.. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F, with the rack in the lower third. Prepare a foil-lined roasting pan with a rack inside. Spray with cooking spray.
.. Season the cavities of the hens with salt and pepper. Stuff each cavity with about 1/2 cup of the prepared stuffing. Tie legs and tuck wings.
.. Place hens in the pan, ensuring they are spaced apart for air circulation.
.. Brush hens with melted butter and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375 degrees F.
.. Continue roasting for 40-50 minutes, glazing every 10 minutes in the last 30 minutes. If hens brown too quickly, cover with foil.
.. Ensure hens are cooked to 180 degrees F in the thigh and juices run clear. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving.
