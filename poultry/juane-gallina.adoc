Juane de Gallina is a traditional Peruvian dish made with chicken, rice, and eggs, all wrapped in banana leaves and steamed to perfection. This flavorful dish requires some patience and attention to detail but is well worth the effort.

== Ingredients

=== For the Rice:
* 3 cups white rice
* 1/8 cup vegetable oil
* 6 sweet peppers, finely chopped
* 1 medium red onion, finely chopped
* 2 turmeric roots, peeled
* 1 bunch fresh cilantro
* 10 leaves sacha culantro (or substitute with additional cilantro)
* 6 cups chicken broth
* Salt and pepper, to taste

=== For the Chicken:
* 8 chicken thighs, bone-in and skin removed
* 3 large garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 bay leaf
* 4 cups chicken broth
* Salt and pepper, to taste

=== To Assemble the Juanes:
* 8 banana leaves (or bijao leaves)
* 1/2 cup black olives
* 4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved
* Vegetable oil, for greasing the leaves
* Thick thread or kitchen twine for tying

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Rice:**
   * Blend 3 cups of chicken broth with the cilantro, sacha culantro (or extra cilantro), and turmeric roots until smooth. If your blender is small, blend in batches.
   * Heat oil in a large saucepan over high heat. Add the finely chopped onion and sweet peppers, sautéing until the onion becomes translucent.
   * Add the rice and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
   * Pour in the blended broth mixture and the remaining chicken broth, ensuring you have a total of 6 cups of liquid.
   * Cook over high heat until the liquid is mostly absorbed, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for an additional 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Season the chicken thighs with crushed garlic, ground turmeric, salt, and pepper.
   * Heat a large pot over high heat and add vegetable oil. Brown the chicken thighs on all sides, about 5 minutes per side.
   * Once browned, reduce the heat to medium, add the bay leaf and chicken broth, and cover. Simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is tender and the broth has mostly evaporated. If any broth remains, strain it and add it to the cooked rice.

3. **Assemble the Juanes:**
   * Wash the banana leaves under running water and dry them. Place a leaf on a flat, clean surface and lightly grease the center with oil.
   * Place about 4 heaping tablespoons of stewed rice in the center of the leaf, add a piece of chicken, 2 pieces of hard-boiled egg, and an olive.
   * Fold the edges of the leaf up to form a pouch, securing it with thick thread or kitchen twine. Repeat until all ingredients are used.

4. **Steam the Juanes:**
   * Fill a steamer with water and bring to a boil. Place the juanes in the steamer and steam for about 30 minutes.
   * Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before serving. Serve directly on the banana leaf with additional olives and boiled eggs if desired.
