Air Fryer Chicken Wings deliver the perfect combination of crispy skin and tender, juicy meat. This method ensures an easy clean-up and is an excellent alternative for those who love the classic taste of fried wings but prefer a healthier approach.

== Ingredients
* 1 1/2 pounds chicken wings
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup hot sauce (Frankâ€™s RedHot recommended)
* 1 tablespoon minced garlic
* 1/2 tablespoon white vinegar
* Nonstick cooking spray
* Optional: Blue cheese sauce or dressing, celery sticks, chopped fresh chives for garnish

== Instructions
. Coat the basket of a 3-quart or larger air fryer with nonstick spray.
. Trim off the wing tips at the joint and discard. Separate the drumette from the flat.
. Pat the wings dry and sprinkle all over with salt.
. Arrange the wings in a single layer in the air fryer, ensuring they do not touch. Cook at 360 degrees F for 12 minutes, then flip the wings and cook for another 12 minutes.
. Increase the air fryer temperature to 390 degrees F. Cook the wings for an additional 6 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the skin is crisp.
. Meanwhile, melt the butter and mix with the hot sauce, garlic, and vinegar.
. Toss the cooked wings in the hot sauce mixture, then serve with optional blue cheese sauce, celery, and chives.
