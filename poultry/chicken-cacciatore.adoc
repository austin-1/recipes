Chicken Cacciatore is a classic Italian dish that features tender chicken braised with vegetables, herbs, and tomatoes. This hearty and flavorful meal is perfect served over pasta, polenta, or with crusty bread.

== Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 6 chicken thighs and leg quarters
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 yellow onions, diced
* 2 stalks of celery, diced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 1/2 green bell peppers, diced
* 1/2 cup pancetta, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 2 pounds chanterelles or other mushrooms, cleaned and sliced
* 3 pounds San Marzano whole tomatoes, crushed by hand
* 1 bunch fresh thyme, rosemary, and oregano, tied together
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 cup dry red wine

== Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   * Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C).

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Season the chicken thighs and leg quarters with salt and pepper on both sides.

3. **Sear the Chicken:**
   * Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Place the chicken in the pan, skin-side down, and cook until golden brown. Turn the chicken and cook until brown on the underside. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

4. **Cook the Pancetta:**
   * Add the pancetta to the pan and cook until it begins to sweat and render fat. Remove the pancetta and set it aside with the chicken.

5. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   * Add the onions, celery, carrot, and bell pepper to the pan. Sweat the vegetables until they are soft, adding additional olive oil if necessary. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, and cook for 1 additional minute.

6. **Deglaze the Pan:**
   * Pour in the dry red wine and deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.

7. **Assemble the Cacciatore:**
   * Add the crushed tomatoes, fresh herbs, mushrooms, pancetta, and chicken back into the pot. Stir to combine.

8. **Braise in the Oven:**
   * Cover the Dutch oven with its lid and place it in the preheated oven. Braise the chicken until it is tender, about 2 hours.

9. **Serve:**
   * Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and discard the herb bundle and bay leaf. Serve the Chicken Cacciatore hot, with crusty bread or over pasta, polenta, or rice.
