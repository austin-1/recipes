== Ingredients
* 8 chicken drumsticks
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Olive oil, for browning
* 1 large onion, thinly sliced
* 3-4 medium carrots, cut into 1/2” pieces
* 1/2 lb button or cremini mushrooms, quartered
* 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 cups red wine
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes
* 1 bay leaf (optional)
* 1-2 sprigs rosemary (optional)
* 1 tablespoon butter (optional)
* 1 tablespoon flour (optional)

== Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   * Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C).

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Pat the chicken drumsticks dry with paper towels. Season liberally with salt and pepper.

3. **Brown the Chicken:**
   * In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add a few tablespoons of olive oil. Brown the chicken in batches until well-browned. Remove the pieces and set aside on a plate.

4. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   * Add the sliced onions and carrot pieces to the pot. Cook until the onions start to turn translucent, about 8-10 minutes. Add the quartered mushrooms and cook until they start to brown. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.

5. **Add Tomato Paste:**
   * Add the tomato paste and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the vegetables are coated.

6. **Deglaze the Pot:**
   * Pour in the red wine to deglaze, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.

7. **Add Remaining Ingredients:**
   * Pour in the chicken stock and canned tomatoes. Add the bay leaf and rosemary if using. Return the browned chicken drumsticks and any accumulated juices back to the pot.

8. **Bring to a Boil:**
   * Turn the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil.

9. **Cook in the Oven:**
   * Cover the pot and place it into the preheated oven. Cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the meat is very tender.

10. **Optional: Thicken the Sauce:**
    * If the sauce needs thickening: Remove the pot from the oven and place it back on the stovetop over medium heat. Remove the chicken to a plate.
    * Mash the butter and flour into a paste and stir into the simmering pot. Continue to simmer and stir until you reach the desired consistency.
    * You can either remove the meat from the bones and add it to the pot or add the whole pieces back in.

11. **Serve:**
    * Serve the chicken and vegetables over mashed potatoes, grits, or rice. Enjoy your Dutch Oven Chicken Drumsticks with Vegetables!
