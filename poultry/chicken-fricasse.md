## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (optional, for extra heat)
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 (14 oz) can fire-roasted tomatoes, drained
- 2 tablespoons flour
- Cooked rice or tortillas, for serving

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides.
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Sear the chicken thighs, skin-side down, until golden brown, about 5-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

2. **Cook the Vegetables:**
   - In the same skillet, add the diced onion, garlic, and bell peppers. Saut√© until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to toast the spices.

3. **Make the Sauce:**
   - Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.
   - Gradually pour in the chicken broth, stirring constantly to create a smooth sauce.
   - Stir in the heavy cream, sour cream, Dijon mustard, lime juice, and fire-roasted tomatoes.
   - Bring the mixture to a simmer, then return the chicken thighs to the skillet, skin-side up.

4. **Simmer the Chicken:**
   - Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer the chicken for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
   - Uncover the skillet and cook for an additional 5-10 minutes to thicken the sauce if necessary.

5. **Finish and Serve:**
   - Stir in the chopped cilantro before serving.
   - Serve the Tucson-inspired chicken fricassee over rice or with warm tortillas, garnished with additional cilantro and lime wedges if desired.

Enjoy the fusion of classic French technique with the bold, sunny flavors of Tucson in this comforting and flavorful dish!
