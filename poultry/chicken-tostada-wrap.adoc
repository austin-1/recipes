== Ingredients

* 5 burrito-size flour tortillas
* 1 pound chicken breast, cooked and shredded
* 1 cup queso blanco
* 4 tostada shells
* 1/2 cup sour cream
* 1/2 cup guacamole
* 1/2 cup red onion, diced
* 1/2 cup tomatoes, diced
* 1 cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded

== Instructions

1. Take one of the flour tortillas and carefully rip it into quarters; you will use these pieces when assembling the tostada wrap.
2. Place a scoop of shredded chicken in the middle of a flour tortilla, leaving plenty of room around the sides to fold the tortilla in.
3. Drizzle queso blanco over the chicken.
4. Spread a dollop of sour cream on a tostada shell and place it on top of the chicken and queso.
5. Add diced tomatoes, onions, and shredded Monterey Jack cheese on top of the tostada shell.
6. Place one quarter of the ripped flour tortilla over all of the toppings.
7. Fold in the outer edges of the large tortilla, pleating the edges as you go to secure the wrap.
8. Carefully transfer the wrap to a skillet and cook over medium-low heat until lightly browned, then flip and cook the other side until browned.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 for each of the remaining wraps.
10. Serve with your favorite toppings such as more sour cream, guacamole, or hot sauce.
