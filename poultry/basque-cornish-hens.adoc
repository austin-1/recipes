== Ingredients
* 2 Rock Cornish game hens
* 4 tbsp butter, plus 2 tbsp melted butter for basting
* 1 lemon, juiced
* Salt, to taste
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 2/3 cup tomato puree
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/4 tsp each of oregano, marjoram, thyme, tarragon, and basil
* 1/2 cup chopped pimento
* 4 tbsp chopped ripe olives

== Directions
. Preheat oven to 350°F.
. Pat the hens dry and skewer the neck opening closed. Fill the cavity with butter, add lemon juice, and sprinkle with salt. Tie shut the abdominal opening.
. Brush the hens with melted butter and roast uncovered for 30 minutes, basting with more butter as needed.
. Remove from the oven and set the hens aside. Pour the drippings into a saucepan, scraping any residue from the roasting pan.
. Sauté the onion in the drippings until transparent. Add chicken broth, tomato puree, bay leaf, oregano, marjoram, thyme, tarragon, basil, pimento, and olives. Bring to a boil, then simmer for about 5 minutes.
. Cut each hen in half along the breastbone and backbone. Place the halves in a shallow casserole dish.
. Pour the sauce over the hens, cover, and bake in the oven at 350°F for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes, basting occasionally.
