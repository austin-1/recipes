== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Combine the black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt in a small bowl.
   * Sprinkle the chicken breasts with the seasoning.
   * In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and brown on both sides, about 5-7 minutes. Set aside.

2. **Make the Mole Sauce:**
   * In the same Dutch oven over medium heat, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.
   * Sauté the diced onions until soft, then add the minced garlic, cinnamon stick, pepitas, chopped almonds, cloves, and raisins. Sauté for 1-2 minutes to blend the flavors.
   * Add the diced tomatoes, chicken stock, orange juice, chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, peanut butter, Mexican chocolate, sugar, chili powder, and cumin. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   * Stir and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and let it cool slightly.

3. **Blend the Mole Sauce:**
   * Carefully transfer the sauce to a blender. Use a hand towel to hold the lid securely while you puree the sauce until smooth. Return the sauce to the Dutch oven.

4. **Cook the Chicken:**
   * Return the browned chicken breasts to the Dutch oven with the mole sauce.
   * Turn the heat to low/medium and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked, reaching an internal temperature of 165°F, about 25-30 minutes depending on the size of the chicken breasts.

5. **Serve:**
   * Serve the chicken mole garnished with sesame seeds, pepitas, and chopped cilantro if desired. Pair with Spanish rice or cauliflower rice for a complete meal.
