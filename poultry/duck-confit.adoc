== Ingredients
* Duck legs (at least 1 per person)
* Kosher salt

== Instructions
. *Dry the Duck:*
.. Pat the duck legs dry with paper towels.
.. Prick the skin of the duck all over with a needle or a very pointy knife, focusing on the skin covering fat. Try to avoid piercing the meat itself by pricking at an angle over the drumstick and thigh.
. *Salt the Duck Legs and Let Rest:*
.. Liberally salt the duck legs. Let them rest at room temperature for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour. Optionally, salt the duck and refrigerate it, uncovered, for up to 8 hours.
. *Prepare the Casserole Dish:*
.. Place the duck legs in a small casserole dish, skin side up. The dish should be just big enough to hold the legs without overlapping. Add a thin layer of oil or melted duck fat to the bottom.
. *Slowly Heat the Duck in the Oven:*
.. Place the casserole in the oven and set it to 300°F (150°C) without preheating. You can reduce the temperature to 285°F (140°C) if you have a digital oven. Cook gently for at least 90 minutes. Check after 90 minutes; the duck should be partly submerged in melted fat and the skin starting to crisp.
. *Brown the Skin:*
.. Once the skin begins to look crispy, increase the oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). Check after 15 minutes for a light golden brown. If some spots aren't crisping due to missed pricks, that’s acceptable.
. *Cool and Strain the Fat:*
.. Remove the duck from the oven and let cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Strain the accumulated fat through cheesecloth if storing for long-term use (up to 6 months in the fridge).
. *Serve:*
.. Enjoy the duck legs as is, letting the fat dribble down your chin, or use the meat in a salad, with beans, rice, or pasta.
