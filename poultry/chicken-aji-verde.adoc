Chicken Aji Verde is a flavorful Peruvian-inspired dish, featuring a whole chicken marinated in a blend of spices, lime, and garlic. It is roasted to perfection atop a bed of potatoes, allowing the flavors to meld and the chicken to become tender and juicy.

== Ingredients
* 1 (4-5 lb) chicken
* 1/2 white onion, peeled
* 1/2 lime
* 4 tbsp butter, melted
* 1/3 cup fresh lime juice
* 6 large garlic cloves, pressed
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tbsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp sugar
* 4 yellow potatoes, cleaned, peeled, and cut into 1-inch thick rounds

== Instructions
1. Prepare the marinade by mixing the melted butter, lime juice, pressed garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, cumin, oregano, and sugar in a bowl until well combined. Refrigerate for about 30 minutes or until the butter starts to harden but remains soft to the touch.
2. Rub the marinade inside the chicken cavity. Gently separate the skin from the breast and thighs using your fingers, then use a small spoon or your fingers to spread the marinade under the skin. Place the half lime and onion inside the cavity and tie the drumstick tips with kitchen twine to seal.
3. Rub the remaining marinade over the entire chicken, then cover and refrigerate for 4-6 hours.
4. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C) with the oven rack adjusted to the lower position.
5. Lightly spray the bottom of a Dutch oven or roaster with cooking spray. Arrange the potato rounds in the bottom to create a bed for the chicken. If you have a rack to space out the chicken, you can skip the potatoes.
6. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes and roast uncovered for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue roasting for 1 hour and 10 minutes.
7. Increase the oven temperature to 450°F (230°C) and roast uncovered for an additional 15 minutes, or until the skin is golden brown and the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C).

Serve the chicken with the roasted potatoes and enjoy the rich, vibrant flavors of this Peruvian-inspired dish.
