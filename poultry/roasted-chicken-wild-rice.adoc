== Ingredients
* 1 whole chicken
* 1 cup wild rice
* 4 tablespoons butter, divided
* 1-1.5 cups water
* 1 bouillon cube
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons onion powder
* 2 teaspoons Adobo seasoning
* 1 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 teaspoons dried rosemary
* Optional: additional seasoning or citrus/fruit juice for brining

== Instructions
. *Prepare the Chicken*
.. Rinse and pat dry the whole chicken. Set aside.
.. Optional Brine: If brining, dissolve 1/4 cup salt in 4 cups water, adding 2 teaspoons each of garlic powder and Adobo seasoning, along with any other preferred seasonings or citrus/fruit juice. Fully cover the chicken with the brine and refrigerate for 24 hours. Rinse and pat dry afterward.
. *Cook the Wild Rice*
.. Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C).
.. Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
.. Sauté 1 cup of wild rice in the Dutch oven for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
.. Add 1-1.5 cups water and 1 bouillon cube. Bring to a low boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.
. *Season the Chicken*
.. Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.
.. Coat the chicken thoroughly with the melted butter.
.. Mix 2 teaspoons each of garlic powder, onion powder, Adobo seasoning, 1 teaspoon each of seasoned salt and black pepper, and 2 teaspoons dried rosemary in a small bowl.
.. Rub the seasoning mixture evenly over the chicken.
. *Combine and Cook*
.. Place the seasoned chicken on top of the wild rice in the Dutch oven.
.. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and the leg-thigh joint pulls off easily.
. *Optional Crisping*
.. For crispier skin, remove the chicken after the initial cooking time, separate the wild rice, and set aside.
.. Increase the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C).
.. Optionally, coat the chicken with additional seasoning or butter and cook uncovered for 30 minutes.
. *Serve*
.. Serve the roasted chicken alongside the wild rice and your favorite vegetables.
