== Ingredients
* 1 skinless chicken breast, bone-in
* 3 cups water
* Salt, to taste
* Pepper, to taste
* 2 parsley sprigs
* 1 bay leaf
* 3 slices white bread
* 2 cups chicken stock, divided
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon ají amarillo paste
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup evaporated milk
* 2 potatoes, boiled and peeled
* 2 cups cooked white rice
* 2 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and cut into fourths
* 4 black olives
* 4 parsley sprigs

== Instructions

1. **Cook the Chicken:**
   * In a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat, cook the chicken breast in 3 cups of water with salt, pepper, parsley sprigs, and bay leaf for about 20 minutes.
   * Remove the chicken from the water, let it cool slightly, and shred the meat with two forks or with your fingers. Set the chicken aside.
   * Strain the stock, discarding the solids.

2. **Prepare the Bread Paste:**
   * Place the bread slices in a bowl and add 1 cup of the chicken stock. After 7 minutes, process in a blender to make a paste. Reserve.

3. **Cook the Aromatics:**
   * In the same saucepan used for cooking the chicken, heat the oil over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic for about 7 minutes, stirring continuously, until the onion is very soft and almost transparent. Do not let them brown.

4. **Make the Sauce:**
   * Add the ají amarillo paste and dried oregano to the saucepan. Cook for 5 more minutes.
   * Stir in the bread paste and 1 more cup of chicken stock, cooking for 3 more minutes until the mixture starts to thicken.
   * Add the shredded chicken, chopped pecans, and grated Parmesan cheese, stirring to combine.
   * Season with salt and pepper to taste, being cautious with the salt as the cheese is already salty.
   * Stir in the evaporated milk and turn off the heat. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with additional chicken stock until it reaches a creamy consistency.

5. **Assemble and Serve:**
   * Cut the cooked potatoes into thick slices and place 2 pieces on each plate.
   * Serve the ají de gallina on top of the potatoes, with white rice on the side.
   * Garnish with quartered hard-boiled eggs, olives, and a parsley sprig. Serve immediately.
