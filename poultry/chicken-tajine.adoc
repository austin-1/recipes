== Ingredients
* 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
* 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 tablespoon ground ginger
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/4 cup green or black olives
* 1/4 cup chopped preserved lemons (or the zest of 1 lemon)
* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1/4 cup dried apricots or prunes, chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* Fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   * Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) with the Handi Pots inside.

2. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   * Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.

3. **Cook the Aromatics:**
   * In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and minced garlic, cooking until softened.

4. **Add the Spices:**
   * Stir in the ground ginger, cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, and coriander. Cook for another minute until the spices are fragrant.

5. **Assemble the Tajine:**

7. **Cook in the Oven:**

8. **Garnish and Serve:**
   * Remove the handi pots from the oven. Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley before serving. Serve with couscous or bread.
