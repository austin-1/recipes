== Ingredients

=== For the Chicken Curry:
* 1 lb (450g) chicken breast, filleted in half
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 tablespoon ginger, minced
* 2 tablespoons curry powder (Durban masala if available)
* 1 teaspoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1-2 green chilies, chopped (optional, for extra heat)
* 2 large tomatoes, chopped
* 1 cup chicken broth or water
* 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed
* Salt to taste
* Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Chicken Curry:**
   * Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until soft and translucent.
   * Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies (if using). Cook for another 2 minutes.
   * Add the curry powder, turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, and garam masala. Cook the spices for a minute until fragrant.
   * Add the cubed potatoes and enough chicken broth or water to cover the ingredients. Season with salt.
   * Stir in the chopped tomatoes and cook until they start to break down and form a thick sauce.
   * Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

2. **Brown the Chicken Breasts:**
   * While the potatoes are simmering, brown each side of the filleted chicken breasts for about 1-2 minutes in a separate pan.
   * Transfer the chicken breasts to a cutting board and cut them into cubes.

3. **Assemble and Cook in the Handi Pots:**
   * Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) with Handi pots inside on a baking sheet lined with a silicone baking mat.
   * Remove the Handi pots from the oven once preheated.
   * Divide the cooked curry evenly between the two 2-cup Handi clay pots and top with the browned chicken cubes.
   * Place the Handi pots back in the preheated oven and bake for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the curry to thicken slightly.

4. **Serve:**
   * Carefully remove the Handi pots from the oven.
   * Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve immediately.
