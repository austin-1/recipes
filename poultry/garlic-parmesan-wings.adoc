Air Fryer Garlic and Parmesan Wings are crispy and packed with flavor, making them the perfect snack for any gathering. They pair wonderfully with a bitter IPA, balancing the robust flavors of garlic and Parmesan.

== Ingredients
* 1 1/2–2 pounds chicken party wings (wingette and drummette separated)
* 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese (plus extra for garnish)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Optional: minced parsley for garnish
* Optional: sliced carrots, celery, and ranch dressing for dipping

== Instructions
. In a large bowl, toss the wings with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.
. Add garlic powder and Parmesan cheese, and toss until evenly coated.
. Transfer the wings to the air fryer basket, arranging them as evenly as possible. Set the air fryer to 375°F and cook for 22-26 minutes, tossing the wings every 5 minutes to ensure even cooking.

. Serve immediately with optional ranch dressing and sliced carrots and celery.
