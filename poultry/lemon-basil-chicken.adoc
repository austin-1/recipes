link:./README.md[&larrhk; Back to Poultry Recipes]

This tender and fragrant chicken dish is perfect for Sunday dinner or any special occasion. The lemon and basil infuse the chicken with fresh, vibrant flavors.

== Ingredients
* 1 medium lemon
* 2 garlic cloves, peeled and divided
* 1/4 cup minced fresh basil, divided
* 1 broiler/fryer chicken (3 to 4 pounds)
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper

== Directions

1. *Preheat the Oven*:
   * Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C).

2. *Prepare the Lemon and Garlic*:
   * Finely grate enough peel from the lemon to measure 2 teaspoons. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice from one half. Set the juice aside.
   * Slice one garlic clove; place the sliced garlic, 2 tablespoons of the basil, and the remaining lemon half inside the chicken cavity.

3. *Season the Chicken*:
   * Place the chicken on a rack in a shallow roasting pan.
   * Rub the chicken with the reserved lemon juice.
   * Mince the remaining garlic and combine it with the melted butter and reserved lemon peel.
   * Rub this mixture all over the chicken.
   * Sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper, and the remaining basil.

4. *Bake the Chicken*:
   * Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for 1-1/4 hours or until the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) and the juices run clear when the thigh is pierced with a fork.
   * If the chicken starts to brown too quickly, loosely cover it with aluminum foil during baking.

5. *Let it Rest*:
   * Once baked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it stand for 10 minutes before carving. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring tender and juicy servings.

6. *Serve*:
   * Carve the chicken and serve it with your choice of sides, such as roasted vegetables, potatoes, or a fresh salad.

Enjoy your Lemon Basil Chicken!
