== Ingredients

* 4 leeks (or 2 bunches of spring onions)
* 1 bouillon cube (chicken)
* 4 tablespoons butter
* 1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
* 4 tablespoons flour
* 1 cup cream
* 3 ounces Gruyère cheese, cubed
* 3 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated
* Salt and ground peppercorns, to taste
* 1 cup diced ham
* Extra Parmesan cheese for sprinkling

=== Tart Shell Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* 1/4 cup ice water

== Instructions

1. **Prepare the Tart Shells:**
   1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
   2. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together. Be careful not to add too much water.
   3. Gather the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
   4. Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to about 1/8-inch thickness. Cut into rounds to fit your tart pans.
   5. Press the dough into the tart pans, trimming any excess. Prick the bottoms with a fork and refrigerate for 15 minutes.
   6. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line the tart shells with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
   7. Bake for 10 minutes, remove the parchment and weights, and bake for an additional 5 minutes or until lightly golden. Let cool.

2. **Prepare the Leeks:**
   1. Remove the tough outer layers and tops from the leeks. Cut them into 1-inch pieces and boil in a small amount of water until tender.
   2. Drain and set aside the cooking water. Dissolve the bouillon cube in a cup of the leek water.

3. **Sauté the Onions:**
   1. In a separate pan, sauté the finely chopped onion in butter until soft. 
   2. Add the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly.

4. **Make the Sauce:**
   1. Gradually add the bouillon and leek water mixture to the pan, stirring constantly until smooth.
   2. Stir in the cream, Gruyère cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt, and ground peppercorns. Cook over low heat until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth.

5. **Prepare the Ham:**
   1. Pat the diced ham with paper towels to remove excess moisture.

6. **Combine Ingredients:**
   1. Add the cooked leeks and diced ham to the cheese sauce, mixing well.

7. **Fill the Tart Shells:**
   1. Fill the pre-baked tart shells with the leek, cheese, and ham mixture.

8. **Bake the Tarts:**
   1. Sprinkle the filled tarts with extra Parmesan cheese and dot with butter.
   2. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 20 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.

9. **Serve:**
   1. Remove the tarts from the tins and serve warm.
