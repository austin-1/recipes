# Adjaruli Khachapuri (Georgian Cheese Bread)

[&larrhk; Back to Bread Recipes](./README.md)

Adjaruli Khachapuri is a traditional Georgian cheese-filled bread shaped like a boat, topped with a perfectly baked egg, and often served with a pat of butter for added richness. This version incorporates local herbs and spices commonly used in Kutaisi, bringing a unique twist to the classic dish.

## Ingredients

### For the Dough
- 3/4 cup water, warmed to 80-90°F
- 3/4 cup milk, warmed to 80-90°F
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 - 4 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt

### For the Topping
- 5 eggs, room temperature, divided
- 2 ounces (1/2 cup) feta cheese, crumbled
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika

## Instructions

1. Mix the water and milk in a large bowl. Add the sugar and mix until dissolved. Sprinkle the yeast over the liquid and let it stand for 5-7 minutes, until foamy. Mix the yeast into the liquid. Add the olive oil and mix well.
2. Mix 2 cups of flour into the yeast mixture. Add the salt. Gradually add the remaining flour, mixing after each addition, until the dough starts to come together.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 5-7 minutes, adding flour as necessary, until a soft (but not sticky) dough forms.
4. Place the dough into a greased bowl, cover with a damp tea towel, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 – 1 1/2 hours, until doubled in bulk.

### For the Topping
1. In a small bowl, mix the shredded mozzarella, feta cheese, one egg, fresh parsley, fresh dill, ground coriander, and smoked paprika. Set aside.

### Putting It All Together
1. Move your oven rack to roughly 6 inches from the top heating unit. Preheat your oven to 475°F.
2. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it onto a floured surface. Divide the dough into 4 even pieces.
3. Shape each piece into an oval, roughly 11 x 6 inches. Place the dough ovals onto greased baking sheets, leaving an inch between each bread.
4. Fold 3/4 of an inch of dough inwards to create a thicker border. Pinch the two small ends into points to create a boat shape.
5. Spoon 1/4 of the filling into the center of each “boat” and smooth it with a spoon.
6. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until lightly golden.
7. Remove from the oven and crack one egg into the center of the bubbling cheese in each boat. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 3-4 minutes, just until the egg has set.
8. Serve warm, optionally with a small pat of butter on top or brush the crust with melted butter before serving.
