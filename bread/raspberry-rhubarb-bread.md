## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cup chopped rhubarb
- 1/2 cup fresh raspberries
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (for coating fruits)
- Powdered sugar for dusting (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups flour, salt, and baking soda.
3. In a large bowl, mix together sugar, buttermilk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just blended.
5. Toss the rhubarb and raspberries with 1 tablespoon of flour to coat them; this helps prevent sinking during baking.
6. Gently fold the coated rhubarb and raspberries into the batter.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
9. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.
10. Dust with powdered sugar before serving if desired.

Enjoy this moist and tangy bread as a nod to Frankenmuth's German heritage and the festive spirit of Oktoberfest!
