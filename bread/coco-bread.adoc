== Ingredients

* 1/2 cup coconut milk
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 packet rapid rise yeast (or 2 1/4 teaspoons)
* 1/2 large egg
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted

== Instructions

1. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and spray with baking spray. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, combine coconut milk, sugar, salt, and butter. Heat in the microwave for about 30 seconds or until the butter melts. Do not let it boil or overheat.
3. Pour the mixture into a large mixing bowl, add the yeast, and mix. Then add the egg.
4. Stir in the flour to form a soft dough. Err on the side of less flour for a tender coco bread.
5. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 3-4 minutes.
6. Place the dough in a greased bowl, turning once to coat it. Cover loosely with a clean cloth and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours or until doubled. Punch the dough down.
7. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured board or surface. Cut the dough into about 10 equal pieces and roll each piece into a ball.
8. Roll each ball with a rolling pin to about 6-7 inches in diameter and about 1/4 inch thick.
9. Brush the surface of each dough piece with melted butter, fold in half, and brush again. Place onto the prepared pan and repeat with remaining pieces.
10. Let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes.
11. Bake in a 350Â°F preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until nicely browned on top.
12. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes. Brush again with butter, if desired.
13. Serve warm or allow to cool. You may freeze the bread when cool and reheat in the oven.
