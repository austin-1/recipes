= Lachuch (Yemenite Flatbread)

== Ingredients

* 3/4-1 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 1/2 cup lukewarm water
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup oil (for addition in the dough)
* 2-3 tablespoons oil (for shallow frying)

== Instructions

1. Dissolve the yeast in lukewarm water with sugar and wait for it to bloom.
2. Once the yeast has bloomed, combine it with all-purpose flour, water, salt, and oil. Mix until you get a lump-free batter.
3. Adjust the consistency to a pancake batter or dosa mix, if needed. Let it rest for an hour.
4. Spray or rub a non-stick pan with oil and warm it, but do not let it get hot.
5. Pour a ladle full of batter onto the pan and let it cook on medium heat for 3-4 minutes.
6. You will notice air pockets forming, and the bread will start leaving the edges once cooked. The top should be cooked and not wet.
7. Remove and let it rest on a clean kitchen towel.
