== Ingredients

* 1 loaf day-old French bread
* 6 eggs
* 1 1/2 cups coffee creamer or heavy cream
* 1-2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
* 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 4 tablespoons butter

== Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Grease a Dutch oven or an oven-safe baking dish.
3. Cut the French bread into small cubes and place them in the prepared dish.
4. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of cinnamon on top of the bread.
5. Make the egg mixture by combining the eggs, cream, vanilla, the remaining cinnamon, sugar, and salt. Thoroughly mix the egg mixture and pour over the bread.
6. Cut the butter into small pieces and scatter them over the bread.
7. Cover the Dutch oven or baking dish with its lid or aluminum foil.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-50 minutes, until the casserole is set and golden brown. Check the casserole early if your oven runs hot or the weather is warm.

== Notes

* If using flavored creamer, cut the vanilla in half.
* Overnight option: Soak the cubed bread in the egg mixture in a plastic bag stored in the refrigerator overnight. Transfer to the baking dish when ready to bake.
