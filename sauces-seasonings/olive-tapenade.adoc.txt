= Olive Tapenade
For a quick and versatile appetizer dip, sandwich spread, or pizza "sauce," try this easy homemade Olive Tapenade. Customize this Mediterranean spread with any variety of briny olives to suit your taste.

== Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups pitted, brine-cured olives (such as Kalamata, Lucques, picholines, or Niçoise)
* 1 teaspoon anchovy paste or 2 anchovy filets, minced
* 3 tablespoons capers, rinsed
* 1 1/2 tablespoons parsley, coarsely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, roasted or raw
* 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1/4 cup olive oil

== Instructions
. In a food processor, combine the olives, anchovies, capers, parsley, garlic, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Pulse 2 to 3 times until coarsely chopped.
. Drizzle in the olive oil and pulse a few more times until a chunky paste forms, scraping down the sides as needed.
. Season to taste with salt and additional pepper if needed.
. Serve the tapenade at room temperature as a dip, spread, or topping.

== Notes
* **Olives:** Use a combination of your favorite brine-cured olives like Kalamata, Lucques, picholines, or Niçoise for a varied flavor profile.
* **Anchovies:** If you're not comfortable handling anchovies, anchovy paste is an easy substitute and adds the same savory, umami flavor.
* **Capers:** Rinse capers well to avoid an overpowering flavor. Both brine-packed and salt-packed capers work well in this recipe.
* **Garlic:** For a mellow, slightly sweet flavor, consider roasting the garlic. To roast, preheat your oven to 400°F, cut the top off a bulb of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, and bake for 45-60 minutes.
* **Storage:** Store leftover tapenade in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. It can also be frozen for up to 3 months.
* **Yield:** This recipe makes about 3 cups of tapenade.

== Variations
* **Kalamata Aioli:** Blend 1 cup pitted Kalamata olives, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 clove garlic, 5 large basil leaves, and 1 cup mayonnaise in a food processor until smooth. Serve with bread chunks.
