== Ingredients
* 3 medium tomatillos, husks removed and rinsed
* 2-3 vine tomatoes (or a 14.5 oz can of Hunt&apos;s brand fire-roasted tomatoes)
* 1/4 tablespoon vegetable oil or extra virgin olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
* 1-2 árbol chilies, stemmed
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* Salt, to taste

== Instructions
. Preheat the broiler to high.
. Arrange the tomatillos and vine tomatoes on a baking sheet. Broil about 4 inches from the heating element for 10-15 minutes, until they begin to char.
. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and chiles, and sauté for 4-5 minutes until fragrant and the garlic turns light golden.
. Add the broiled tomatillos, roasted tomatoes, chilies, garlic, cumin, and salt to a blender or food processor.
. Process until smooth.
. Season with additional salt, to taste.
. Refrigerate the salsa for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together. Enjoy with your favorite dishes!

== Notes
* If using vine tomatoes instead of canned fire-roasted tomatoes, broil them along with the tomatillos to achieve a similar smoky flavor.
