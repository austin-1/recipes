Adapted from _Williams Sonoma_

== Ingredients
* 1/2 orange
* 2 cups water
* 1 tart apple (such as Granny Smith, Pippin, or McIntosh)
* 3 cups fresh cranberries
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves

== Directions
. Squeeze the juice from the orange and set the juice aside. Remove and discard the membrane from inside the orange rind, then dice the rind into small pieces.
. In a small saucepan over high heat, combine the diced orange rind and water, and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.
. Peel, core, and quarter the apple. Cut into 1/2-inch dice and place in a saucepan.
. Sort through the cranberries, discarding any soft ones. Add the cranberries to the apples, along with the orange juice, orange rind, sugar, cinnamon, and cloves.
. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and partially cover the pan. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, the apple is tender, and the cranberries have burst, about 10 to 15 minutes.
. Transfer the cranberry sauce to a heatproof bowl and let it cool for 1 hour before serving. Alternatively, cover and refrigerate the sauce; bring to room temperature before serving.
