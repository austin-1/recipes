## Ingredients

- 1 (16-ounce) package medium-wide egg noodles
- 1 cup butter, divided
- 2 large leeks, cleaned and sliced (white and light green parts only)
- 1 large head green cabbage, cored and thinly sliced
- Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh dill, chopped
- 1/2 cup crumbled goat cheese

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, melt 1/2 cup of butter over medium heat. Add the sliced leeks and sauté until they start to soften and become translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Stir in the sliced cabbage and the remaining 1/2 cup butter. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is tender and slightly caramelized, about 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
5. Combine the cooked noodles, cabbage mixture, and chopped dill in a large roasting pan. Mix gently to blend the flavors.
6. Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese over the top.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is slightly golden and the cheese has softened, about 25 minutes.

Serve this delightful dish warm, perfect for a light lunch or as a side to your favorite summer meal.
