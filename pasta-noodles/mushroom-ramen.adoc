== Ingredients

* 1 (1-ounce) package dried shiitake mushrooms
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large shallots, minced
* 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
* 6 cups chicken stock
* 1 1/2 tablespoons white miso paste
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce
* 3 slices bacon
* 3/4 pound fresh assorted mushrooms, sliced
* 2 (3.5-ounce) packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packets discarded
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 4 soft boiled eggs, peeled and halved
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced

== Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the dried shiitake mushrooms and 2 cups of hot water. Let stand until softened, about 20-30 minutes. Drain, reserving the mushroom water, then coarsely chop the mushrooms. Set aside.
2. Heat canola oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add garlic, shallots, and ginger, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
3. Stir in the reserved shiitake mushrooms and cook until golden and browned, about 3 minutes.
4. Add the reserved mushroom water, chicken stock, white miso paste, soy sauce, and bacon. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer until the flavors have blended, about 15-20 minutes. Remove and discard the bacon.
5. Stir in the assorted mushrooms and simmer until softened, about 3-5 minutes.
6. Add the ramen noodles and cook until just tender, about 3 minutes.
7. Stir in the rice wine vinegar and season with additional soy sauce and pepper, to taste.
8. Serve immediately, garnished with soft boiled eggs and green onions.
