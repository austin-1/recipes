link:./README.me[&larrhk; Back to Pasta &amp; Noodles]

A Thai stir-fry with glass noodles and mixed vegetables, traditionally cooked swiftly on a stove, but in this version, we start on the stove and finish in the oven using a preheated handi pot for deeper flavors and textures.

== Ingredients

* 100g (about 3.5 oz) glass noodles (mung bean noodles)
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 small onion, sliced

== Method

1. **Preheat the Handi Pot:**
   * Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the empty handi pot inside the oven to heat while you prepare the other ingredients.

2. **Prepare the Noodles:**
   * Soak the glass noodles in hot water for 10-15 minutes until softened, then drain and set aside.

3. **Cook the Aromatics and Vegetables:**
   * In a separate pan on the stove, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
   * Sauté the garlic and onion until fragrant. Add the carrot, mushrooms, bell peppers, and cabbage, cooking until just tender.

4. **Scramble the Eggs:**
   * In the same pan, push the vegetables to the side and pour the beaten eggs into the cleared space, scrambling them until just set.

5. **Combine with Seasonings:**
   * Add the soaked and drained glass noodles to the pan along with soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, and white pepper, stirring to mix well.

6. **Transfer to the Handi Pot:**
   * Remove the hot handi pot from the oven carefully using oven mitts.
   * Transfer the noodle and vegetable mixture into the handi pot, pour in the chicken broth or water, and stir everything together.

7. **Bake:**
   * Return the handi pot to the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes, until the mixture is hot and the flavors have melded together.

8. **Garnish and Serve:**
   * Garnish with chopped cilantro or sliced green onions.
   * Serve directly from the handi pot with lime wedges on the side.
