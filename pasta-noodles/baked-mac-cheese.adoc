link:./README.me[&larrhk; Back to Pasta &amp; Noodles]

This baked mac and cheese is made lighter with a combination of almond milk and vegetable broth, and uses almond meal instead of breadcrumbs. It's creamy, cheesy, comforting, and sure to become a new family favorite!

== Ingredients

* 1 lb elbow macaroni
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups unsweetened almond milk
* 2 cups vegetable broth
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 3 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided
* 1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup almond meal or breadcrumbs

== Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F and spray a 9x13 baking dish with cooking spray.
2. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente (slightly undercooked).
3. While the pasta is cooking, add butter to a large saucepan and heat over low heat. Once the butter is melted, whisk in the flour until combined.
4. Add the almond milk, vegetable broth, salt, and pepper, and bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Raise the heat to medium-high, and continue whisking until the mixture is smooth and thick.
5. Remove the saucepan from heat and slowly add 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, mixing until fully melted and smooth.
6. Add the cooked pasta to the cheese mixture and stir until the pasta is fully coated.
7. Transfer the pasta to the prepared baking dish and top with the remaining 1 cup of cheddar cheese and the parmesan cheese. Sprinkle the almond meal or breadcrumbs over the top.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes until bubbly and the top begins to brown. Broil for the last 2 minutes to brown the top even more, watching closely to avoid burning the cheese.
9. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.
