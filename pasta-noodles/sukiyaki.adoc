A warm and satisfying vegetarian version of sukiyaki, perfect for cooler evenings. This dish features a rich broth with a variety of vegetables, tofu, and udon noodles, making it both hearty and comforting.

== Ingredients

* 1/2 small head of napa cabbage, cut into 2-inch chunks
* 1 package beech mushrooms, ends cut off and separated
* 1 package enoki mushrooms, ends cut off and separated into small chunks
* 1 carrot, cut into coins
* 1/2 onion, sliced
* 1/2 package firm tofu, cut into squares
* 1 package udon noodles
* 1 cup edamame (for protein)
* 1 cup sake
* 1 cup mirin
* 1 cup soy sauce, divided (1 tablespoon for marinating tofu)
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1 cup water or vegetable broth

== Directions

1. **Marinate the Tofu:**
   * Marinate the tofu with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 tablespoon brown sugar.

2. **Make Sukiyaki Sauce:**
   * Mix the sake, mirin, white sugar, and remaining soy sauce together.

3. **Cook the Tofu and Onions:**
   * Heat a 3 or 4-quart dutch oven (preferably cast iron) over medium heat. Add the marinated tofu and cook until just done. Set aside the tofu.
   * Add the onions to the dutch oven and pour about 1 tablespoon of sukiyaki sauce over them. Sauté until the onions are soft. Turn off the heat.

4. **Prepare and Cook the Sukiyaki:**
   * Arrange the napa cabbage, mushrooms, carrot, edamame, and tofu in sections around the dutch oven.
   * Pour in 1 cup of water or vegetable broth and add enough sukiyaki sauce to just barely cover the vegetables and tofu.
   * Put the lid on and cook over high heat until boiling, then reduce to medium. Cook until the hardest vegetables are done, about 5-10 minutes more.
   * Nestle the udon noodles into the broth to cook for 2-3 minutes, ensuring it doesn’t boil over.

5. **Finish and Serve:**
   * When done, place the cooked tofu on top and cover with the lid until ready to serve. Serve with rice.
