== Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter
* 1/2 pound pancetta or thick-cut bacon, diced
* 1-2 garlic cloves, minced (optional)
* 3-4 whole eggs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese
* 1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)
* Salt and black pepper, to taste

== Method

1. **Heat Pasta Water:**
   * Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).

2. **Sauté Pancetta/Bacon and Garlic:**
   * While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy. 
   * Add the garlic (if using) and cook for another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.

3. **Beat Eggs and Cheese:**
   * In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the grated cheese.

4. **Cook Pasta:**
   * Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta and cook uncovered until al dente (still a little firm, not mushy).

5. **Toss Pasta with Pancetta/Bacon:**
   * When the pasta is al dente, use tongs to move it to the bowl with the pancetta and garlic, ensuring the pasta is dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water. 
   * Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn’t make the eggs curdle when you mix them in.

6. **Add the Egg Mixture:**
   * Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine. Add salt to taste.
   * If the pasta looks dry, add some of the reserved pasta water to keep it moist. Serve immediately with the remaining Parmesan cheese and freshly ground black pepper. If desired, sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley.
