. Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.
. Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before serving.

== Light Béchamel Sauce
A classic white sauce that adds creaminess to lasagna dishes.

=== Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 4 cups milk
* Salt to taste
* Freshly ground white pepper to taste
* A pinch of ground nutmeg (optional)

=== Method
. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
. Once the butter is melted, add the flour and whisk continuously for 1-2 minutes to form a roux.
. Gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes.
. Season with salt, white pepper, and nutmeg, if using. Stir to combine.
. Remove from heat and set aside until ready to use.
