## Ingredients

- 1 lb elbow macaroni
- 1/4 cup butter
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk
- 2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup cooked, chopped green beans
- 1/2 cup toasted slivered almonds
- 2 cups shredded Gruyère cheese, divided
- 1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs mixed with 2 tablespoons melted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and grease a 9x13 baking dish.
2. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente.
3. While the pasta cooks, melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Whisk in the flour to form a roux.
4. Gradually add the almond milk and vegetable broth, whisking constantly. Increase the heat to medium-high, and continue to whisk until the mixture thickens and begins to bubble.
5. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 1/2 cups Gruyère and 1/2 cup Parmesan until the cheeses are melted and the sauce is smooth.
6. Stir in the cooked green beans and toasted almonds, then add the cooked pasta, mixing until everything is evenly coated.
7. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup Gruyère, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and the buttered panko breadcrumbs.
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown. Broil for 2-3 minutes to crisp the breadcrumb topping, watching closely to avoid burning.
9. Let the dish cool slightly before serving to allow the flavors to meld.

This dish elevates traditional mac and cheese with the inclusion of green beans and almonds, offering a nod to classic Almondine style while remaining creamy and comforting.
