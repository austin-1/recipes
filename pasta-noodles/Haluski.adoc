= Haluski - Cabbage and Noodles

This Haluski recipe is a traditional Eastern European dish made with buttery egg noodles, fried cabbage, and onions. It's a simple, hearty, and flavorful dish that's perfect for sharing with family and friends.

== Ingredients

* 1 (16-ounce) package medium-wide egg noodles
* 1 cup butter, divided
* 2 large onions, chopped
* 2 small heads cabbage, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces
* Salt and ground black pepper, to taste

== Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well and set aside.
3. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the chopped onions and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 5 to 10 minutes.
4. Add the cabbage and the remaining 1/2 cup butter to the onions. Cook and stir until the cabbage is softened but not browned, about 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
5. Place the cooked noodles and cabbage mixture in a large roasting pan. Stir gently to combine. Sprinkle with more salt and black pepper, if desired.
6. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, about 30 to 40 minutes.
