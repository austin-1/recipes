== Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1/2 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 4 small tomatoes, diced; or 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded kashkaval cheese
* 4 large egg yolks
* Crusty bread, for serving

== Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°F.
2. Warm the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion, red bell pepper, and garlic.
3. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften but not brown, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the salt, coriander, and tomatoes. Cook until slightly reduced, about 8 minutes. Set the relish aside.
5. Spread the shredded kashkaval cheese in an even layer on the bottom of a 12-inch ovenproof skillet.
6. Spoon the tomato relish into 4 circles placed evenly around the pan, making an indentation in the center of each to hold the egg yolks.
7. Bake until the cheese is melted and browning, about 15 minutes.
8. Add the egg yolks to the relish circles and bake for another minute.
9. Serve immediately with crusty bread.
