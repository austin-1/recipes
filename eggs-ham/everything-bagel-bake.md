[&larrhk; Back to Eggs &amp; Ham Recipes](./README.md)

This breakfast bake combines the flavors of everything bagels with sausage, eggs, and cheese, creating a hearty and satisfying dish. It's perfect for brunch or a special morning meal, bringing together a variety of ingredients into a flavorful casserole.

## Ingredients

- 1½ cups grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese
- 2 tablespoons butter, plus more for the baking dish
- 1½ cups grated cheddar cheese
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 (10-ounce) package frozen spinach, thawed
- 8 eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1 cup half-and-half
- 3 day-old everything bagels, halved and cut into big chunks
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 2 large tomatoes, cut into chunks
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
- 1 (8-ounce) brick cream cheese, cold, cut into 14 cubes
- 1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Directions

1. Heat a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat.

2. Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-low heat, then add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden and translucent, about 9 minutes.

3. While the onion is cooking, pile the thawed spinach into the center of a clean kitchen towel and roll up the towel. Over a bowl or the sink, twist the ends toward each other and wring out as much liquid as possible. Transfer the spinach to the bowl with the sausage.

4. Add the onion, bagel chunks, tomatoes, basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, 1 cup each of the Gruyère and cheddar, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper to the bowl. Toss it all together with your hands or a spoon.

5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, half-and-half, mustard, cayenne, and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt and 1½ teaspoon black pepper.

6. Grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with butter and arrange the bagel mixture in the dish. Pour the egg mixture over the top, pressing down on the bagels so they soak up the liquid. Nestle the cream cheese chunks throughout the pan. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours.

7. Preheat the oven to 400°F.

8. Uncover the dish and sprinkle with the remaining ½ cup each Gruyère and cheddar. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake until the top is golden and the center is set, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
