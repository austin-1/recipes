= The Ultimate Leek Patties

These leek patties are a delicious and savory dish, perfect as an appetizer or a light meal. The tender leeks are combined with breadcrumbs and eggs, then pan-fried to golden perfection. Serve them with Greek yogurt or homemade tahini for a delightful experience.

== Ingredients

* 2 medium-sized leeks (about 0.5 kg / 1.1 lb), well cleaned
* 1-2 large eggs
* 1/3 cup breadcrumbs
* Fine sea salt, to taste
* Black pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup olive oil, for shallow frying

== Instructions

. **For the leeks:**
  * Halve the leeks lengthwise, then thinly slice. If the green part of the leek is nice and fresh, use it as well.
  * Place the chopped leeks in a medium saucepan, add water to 3/4 up the height of the leeks, and bring to a boil.
  * Cook over medium-high heat for 40-60 minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the water has evaporated and the leeks are completely tender. Continue cooking, stirring often, for 5 minutes over medium-low heat to dry out the leeks even more.

. **To form the patties:**
  1. Move the cooked leeks to a large bowl. Add the eggs, breadcrumbs, salt, and pepper to season, and stir to combine.
  2. Heat the olive oil in a wide nonstick pan over medium-high heat.
  3. Using wet hands, take about a heaped tablespoon from the mixture and form it into a 1 cm (0.5 inch) thick round patty shape.
  4. Lay 5-6 patties in the pan and fry for 2-3 minutes on each side until nice and golden.
  5. Remove using a spatula onto paper towels. Continue forming and frying patties from the rest of the mixture.
  6. Serve at once, alongside Greek yogurt or homemade tahini.

. **Storage:**
  * The patties can be kept refrigerated for 3-4 days or frozen for up to 3 months.

== Recipe Notes

* Preparing a double batch is highly recommended!

. **For a vegan + gluten-free version:**
  * Replace the eggs and breadcrumbs with 3-4 tablespoons of red lentil or chickpea flour. Gradually add just a bit of water to create a mixture that holds and can be shaped into patties.

. **For a Paleo version:**
  * Replace the breadcrumbs with one medium potato, finely grated and firmly squeezed of excess water.

. **To bake:**
  * Form the patties as desired. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Drizzle each patty with olive oil on both sides and bake in a 200°C (400°F) oven for 12 minutes or until golden.
