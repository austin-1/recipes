Cajun Pickled Eggs are a Southern delicacy that combines hard-cooked eggs with bold Cajun seasoning, hot sauce, and vinegar. Over time, the eggs absorb the spicy, tangy flavors, making them a unique and flavorful snack or appetizer.

== Ingredients

* 10 to 12 large hard-cooked eggs, peeled
* 1 tablespoon store-bought or homemade Cajun seasoning
* 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons store-bought or homemade hot pepper sauce
* 6 tablespoons distilled white vinegar

== Directions

1. Gently pack the peeled eggs into a 1-quart (946-ml) mason jar, sprinkling them with Cajun seasoning as you go.
2. In a small saucepan, combine the hot pepper sauce and vinegar. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring frequently. Pour the hot mixture over the eggs in the jar.
3. Seal the jar and let it cool to room temperature. Place the jar in the refrigerator, giving it a gentle shake every couple of days to redistribute the spices.
4. Allow the eggs to pickle for at least 2 weeks and up to 3 months. The flavor will start out hot and vinegary but will develop complexity and a deeper Cajun spice profile over time.
