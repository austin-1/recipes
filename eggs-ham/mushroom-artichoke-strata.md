## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil

- 1 (14 oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder

- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Pour the salsa macha over the cubed bread, toss to coat evenly and set aside.
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8 minutes.
   - Add the chopped artichoke hearts, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to combine the flavors.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Assemble the Strata:**
   - Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
   - Spread half of the cubed bread evenly in the dish.
   - Top with half of the mushroom and artichoke mixture and half of the shredded cheese.
   - Repeat with the remaining bread, mushroom-artichoke mixture, and cheese.

3. **Prepare the Custard:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, then gradually add the Dijon mustard, heavy cream, and milk.
   - Pour the custard evenly over the bread and vegetable layers in the baking dish.

4. **Bake:**
   - Bake the strata for 55 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set.
   - Let the strata cool for 10 minutes before serving.

5. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Sprinkle with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro before serving.
