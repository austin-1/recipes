## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cups sliced mushrooms (cremini or portobello)
- 1 (14 oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 6 cups cubed day-old bread (sourdough or French bread)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cheese (cheddar or Monterey Jack)
- 8 large eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1/3 cup salsa macha
- 2 green onions, sliced (for garnish)
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Filling:**
   - Pour the salsa macha over the cubed bread, toss to coat evenly and set aside.
   - Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
   - Stir in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, about 8 minutes.
   - Add the chopped artichoke hearts, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 2 minutes to combine the flavors.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Assemble the Strata:**
   - Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.
   - Spread half of the cubed bread evenly in the dish.
   - Top with half of the mushroom and artichoke mixture and half of the shredded cheese.
   - Repeat with the remaining bread, mushroom-artichoke mixture, and cheese.

3. **Prepare the Custard:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, heavy cream, Dijon mustard, and hot sauce (if using).
   - Pour the custard evenly over the bread and vegetable layers in the baking dish.

4. **Chill and Bake:**
   - Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight, allowing the bread to soak up the custard.
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Remove the plastic wrap and bake the strata for 45-55 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center is set.
   - Let the strata cool for 10 minutes before serving.

5. **Garnish and Serve:**
   - Sprinkle with sliced green onions and fresh cilantro before serving.
