== Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 1/2 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon za'atar
* 4 small tomatoes, diced; or 1 (14-ounce) can diced tomatoes
* 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded provolone cheese
* 1/2 cup labneh
* 4 large egg yolks
* Za'atar and olive oil for finishing
* Crusty bread or warm pita, for serving

== Instructions

=== Prepare the Tomato Relish
1. Warm the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion, red bell pepper, and minced garlic.
2. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften but not brown, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the kosher salt, ground coriander, za'atar, and diced tomatoes. Cook until the mixture is slightly reduced, about 8 minutes.
4. Set the tomato relish aside.

=== Assemble and Bake the Dish
5. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
6. Spread the shredded provolone cheese and dollops of labneh in an even layer on the bottom of a 12-inch ovenproof skillet.
7. Spoon the prepared tomato relish into 4 circles placed evenly around the pan, making an indentation in the center of each to hold the egg yolks.
8. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling and browning, about 15 minutes.
9. Carefully add the egg yolks to the relish circles and bake for another minute, just until the yolks are set.
10. Sprinkle with za'atar and drizzle with olive oil before serving.
11. Serve immediately with crusty bread or warm pita.
