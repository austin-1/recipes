== Ingredients

* 8 large eggs
* 1/4 cup milk
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 1 cup diced ham
* 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1 cup fresh spinach leaves, chopped
* 1/2 cup diced onion
* 1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your choice)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil

== Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, salt, and pepper until well combined.
3. Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the cherry tomatoes to the skillet and cook for another 2-3 minutes until they start to soften.
5. Stir in the chopped spinach and cook until wilted, about 1-2 minutes.
6. Add the diced ham to the skillet and stir everything together.
7. Pour the egg mixture over the ham and vegetables in the skillet. Gently stir to ensure even distribution of ingredients.
8. Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the top of the egg mixture.
9. Cook on the stovetop for about 2-3 minutes until the edges start to set.
10. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the frittata is fully set and the top is golden brown.
11. Remove the frittata from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve warm.
