## Ingredients

### Black Bean Paté
- 4 cups dried black beans, sorted and rinsed
- 1 large yellow onion, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt
- 4 large eggs, lightly beaten
- Zest of 1 lime
- Juice of 1/2 lime
- 2 teaspoons sea salt
- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)

### Green Onion Sauce
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 4 green onions, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon honey or agave nectar
- 1½ cups extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

### Black Bean Paté

1. **Cook the Beans:** 
   - Place the rinsed black beans in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the beans are tender. Drain and allow the beans to cool.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:** 
   - In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until soft and caramelized, about 8-10 minutes. Stir in the smoked paprika, cumin, and coriander, and cook for another 2 minutes until fragrant. Remove from heat.

3. **Prepare the Mixture:** 
   - In a food processor, pulse the cooked black beans until coarsely chopped. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped beans with the sautéed onion mixture, Greek yogurt, beaten eggs, lime zest, lime juice, salt, pepper, and thyme (if using). Mix well to ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.

4. **Bake the Paté:** 
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a loaf pan or terrine dish with olive oil or butter. Transfer the black bean mixture into the prepared pan, pressing down to ensure it's evenly packed. Cover with foil and place the pan in a larger baking dish. Fill the baking dish halfway with hot water to create a water bath.
   - Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until the paté is firm to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool completely before slicing.

### Green Onion Sauce

1. **Prepare the Sauce:** 
   - In a food processor, combine the egg yolk, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, green onions, garlic, and honey. Process until smooth.
   - With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until the mixture emulsifies into a thick, creamy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

2. **Serve:** 
   - Slice the black bean paté and serve with a generous drizzle of green onion sauce.
