== Ingredients

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 2 (14-ounce) cans no-salt diced tomatoes, or about 4 cups ripe diced tomatoes
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1/2 teaspoon mild chili powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* Pinch of cayenne pepper, or more to taste
* Pinch of sugar (optional, to taste)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 6 eggs
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley, for garnish

== Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about a minute more. Add the diced bell pepper and cook until softened, about 7-10 minutes.
2. Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, mild chili powder, cumin, paprika, cayenne pepper, and sugar (if using) to the skillet. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to reduce. Adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and spices to taste.
3. Create spaces in the sauce for each egg with a ladle or large spoon. Crack each egg into a prepared space, allowing it to settle into the sauce. Repeat for all 6 eggs.
4. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, checking regularly, until the eggs are cooked to your liking.
5. Garnish with minced parsley and serve immediately.
