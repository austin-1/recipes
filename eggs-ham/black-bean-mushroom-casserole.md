## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for the baking dish and frying the eggs
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 pound white mushrooms, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 1 large or 2 medium jalapeño peppers, seeded and diced
- 1½ teaspoons kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/4 cup chicken broth or water
- 8 (8-inch) flour tortillas
- Tomatillo Sauce (recipe follows)
- 2 cups shredded Colby Jack cheese
- 6 eggs
- 1 avocado, sliced, for serving

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. In a large skillet, heat the 3 tablespoons oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until soft and lightly golden, about 9 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.

3. Add the mushrooms, jalapeños, salt, and black pepper. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms release their water and soften, about 7 minutes.

4. Add the cilantro, cumin, black beans, and broth, and cook, stirring gently, until heated through, about 3 minutes.

5. Grease a 10 x 12-inch baking dish with vegetable oil. Spoon ½ cup of the bean filling into a tortilla, roll it up into a log, and place it seam-side down in the dish. Repeat with the remaining filling and tortillas, lining them up to fill the dish.

6. Pour 1 cup of the tomatillo sauce over the rolled tortillas, leaving a few spots exposed. Sprinkle the cheese on top and bake until the cheese is bubbling and the edges are crisped, 25 to 30 minutes.

7. About 5 minutes before the casserole is done, fry the eggs to your preference, so they're ready when the casserole comes out of the oven.

8. Cut the casserole into 6 squares, divide among plates, and top each serving with an egg and some avocado slices. Garnish with cilantro and serve with extra tomatillo sauce on the side.
