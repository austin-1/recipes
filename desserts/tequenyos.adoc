= Venezuelan Tequeños

Venezuelan Tequeños are a popular appetizer or snack made with a dough of sweet plantains and oat flour wrapped around cheese sticks. This version is air-fried, making it a healthier alternative to the traditional deep-fried tequeños.

== Ingredients

* 2 medium ripe sweet plantains, cooked (280g approx)
* 80g oat flour
* Pinch of salt
* 2 egg yolks
* Cheese sticks for filling

== Instructions

1. Mash the cooked sweet plantains.
2. Add the oat flour and salt, kneading with your hands until all the ingredients are well integrated.
3. Form a ball with the dough and place it between two sheets of parchment paper.
4. Flatten the dough using a rolling pin.
5. Cut the dough into a rectangle by trimming the excess with a pizza cutter.
6. Slice the dough vertically into strips about 1/3 inch wide and 5 inches long.
7. Wrap the dough strips around the cheese sticks, ensuring there are no visible holes. You may need two strips of dough for each cheese stick.
8. Once all the tequeños are prepared, set them aside.
9. In a small bowl, beat one egg yolk and brush the tequeños with it.
10. Place the tequeños on a wire rack and cook them in an air fryer or oven at 425°F for 10 minutes, or until golden.
11. Remove and serve warm with your favorite sauce.
