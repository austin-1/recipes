## Ingredients:

### For the Brownie Layer:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder

### For the Cookie Layer:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup dark chocolate chips

### For the Homemade Caramel:
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt (more for sprinkling)

## Instructions:

### Make the Homemade Caramel:
1. **Cook the Sugar**: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula. The sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick amber-colored liquid. Be careful not to burn it.
   
2. **Add the Butter**: Once the sugar is completely melted, add the butter. The mixture will bubble up, so be cautious. Stir until the butter is fully melted and combined.

3. **Add the Cream**: Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream while stirring continuously. Again, the mixture will bubble up. Continue to stir until the mixture is smooth.

4. **Finish the Caramel**: Let the caramel boil for 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla extract and sea salt. Set aside to cool slightly.

### Make the Brownie Layer:
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease 12 silicone muffin molds.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a small mixing bowl, combine the cocoa powder, flour, salt and baking powder.

2. **Prepare the Brownie Batter**: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the melted butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined. Sift in the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth.

### Make the Cookie Layer:

1. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a small mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt and baking soda.

2. **Prepare the Cookie Dough**: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing well. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.

### Assemble and Bake:

1. **Layer the Brownie Batter**: Spoon about 1 1/2 tablespoons of brownie batter into the bottom of each muffin cup, spreading it evenly.

2. **Pre-bake the Brownie layer**: Place the silicone molds about 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes.

3. **Add Caramel**: Remove muffin molds from oven. Drop a spoonful of the homemade caramel sauce over the brownie layer.

4. **Layer the Cookie Dough**: Shape a flat round patty of cookie dough to cover the top of each mold.

5. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 18 minutes, or until the cookie tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

6. **Cool and Finish**: Let the cookie brownies cool in the molds for about 10 minutes before removing. Drizzle with any remaining caramel sauce and sprinkle with sea salt before serving.
