## Ingredients:

### For the Brownie Layer:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder

### For the Cookie Layer:
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chocolate chips

### For the Homemade Caramel:
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
- 1/2 cup heavy cream, at room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt (more for sprinkling)

## Instructions:

### Make the Homemade Caramel:
1. **Cook the Sugar**: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the sugar, stirring constantly with a heat-resistant spatula. The sugar will form clumps and eventually melt into a thick amber-colored liquid. Be careful not to burn it.
   
2. **Add the Butter**: Once the sugar is completely melted, add the butter. The mixture will bubble up, so be cautious. Stir until the butter is fully melted and combined.

3. **Add the Cream**: Slowly drizzle in the heavy cream while stirring continuously. Again, the mixture will bubble up. Continue to stir until the mixture is smooth.

4. **Finish the Caramel**: Let the caramel boil for 1-2 minutes, then remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla extract and sea salt. Set aside to cool slightly.

### Make the Brownie Layer:
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a standard 12-cup muffin tin or line it with paper liners.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients**: In a mixing bowl, combine the cocoa powder, flour, salt and baking powder.

2. **Prepare the Brownie Batter**: Cream together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined. Sift in the dry ingredients and stir until the batter is smooth.

### Make the Cookie Layer:
1. **Prepare the Cookie Dough**: In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract, mixing well. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.

### Assemble the Muffin Tin Cookie Brownies:
1. **Layer the Brownie Batter**: Spoon about 1-2 tablespoons of brownie batter into the bottom of each muffin cup, spreading it evenly.

2. **Add Caramel**: Drop a spoonful of the homemade caramel sauce over the brownie layer.

3. **Layer the Cookie Dough**: Top the caramel with a spoonful of cookie dough, spreading it to cover the caramel.

4. **Bake**: Bake in the preheated oven for 15-18 minutes, or until the cookie tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

5. **Cool and Finish**: Let the cookie brownies cool in the muffin tin for about 10 minutes before removing. Drizzle with any remaining caramel sauce and sprinkle with sea salt before serving.
