## Ingredients

### Baklava
- 2 cups coarsely chopped, peeled apples (preferably Granny Smith or Honeycrisp)
- 1½ cups toasted and chopped pecans or walnuts, or a mixture of both
- ½ cup sugar
- ¼ cup golden raisins
- 1 teaspoon lemon zest
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1½ pounds frozen filo (phyllo) dough, thawed
- 1 cup unsalted butter, melted

### Syrup
- 1½ cups sugar
- 1½ cups water
- 1½ cups Texas honey
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 to 3 whole cloves
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice

## Instructions

### Syrup Preparation
1. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, water, honey, cinnamon, cloves, and lemon juice.
2. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
3. Remove the cloves and allow the syrup to cool completely while you prepare the baklava.

### Baklava Assembly
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Brush a 9" x 13" glass baking dish with some of the melted butter.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped apples, toasted nuts, sugar, raisins, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cinnamon. Stir until the mixture is well combined and set aside.
3. Lay 6 sheets of filo dough in the baking dish, brushing each sheet generously with melted butter before adding the next. Be sure to keep the remaining filo covered with a damp towel to prevent it from drying out.
4. Spread half of the apple-nut mixture evenly over the filo layers.
5. Layer 4 more sheets of filo dough on top, brushing each with melted butter. Spread the remaining apple mixture over this layer.
6. Top with the final 6 sheets of filo dough, again brushing each sheet with butter.
7. Using a sharp knife, cut the baklava into squares or diamonds.
8. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the filo is golden and crisp.

### Final Touch
1. Once the baklava is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for about 5 minutes.
2. Pour the cooled syrup evenly over the warm baklava, making sure it seeps into all the cuts and corners.
3. Allow the baklava to cool completely, giving the syrup time to be fully absorbed.

### Serving
- This Texas Hill Country Apple Strudel Baklava makes approximately 18 rich servings. It can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week, though it's best enjoyed within a few days when the filo is still crisp.
