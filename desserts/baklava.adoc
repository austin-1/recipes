= Baklava

Baklava is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with layers of flaky Fillo dough, butter, and a sweet nut filling, all soaked in a rich honey syrup. This version is cooked in a Dutch oven, giving it a unique twist on the classic preparation method.

== Ingredients

* 24 sheets Fillo (phylo) dough (thaw in fridge overnight, do not leave on counter)
* 1 cup butter, melted
* 1 1/2 cups finely chopped pecans
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon

=== Lemon Honey Syrup
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 3/4 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon honey

== Instructions

1. Prepare honey syrup by combining all syrup ingredients and bringing to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then chill.
2. Melt butter. Mix pecans, sugar, and cinnamon; set aside.
3. Butter the bottom of a 12-inch Dutch oven generously. Lay 1 sheet of Fillo dough in the bottom of the Dutch oven, keeping the remaining dough covered with a damp cloth. Using a pastry brush, butter the top, beginning at the edges and working towards the center. Repeat this step until 8 sheets of Fillo dough are layered in the Dutch oven, buttering each layer.
4. Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture evenly over the Fillo dough.
5. Place 8 more sheets of Fillo dough on top of the nut mixture, buttering between each layer. Sprinkle the remaining nut mixture on top.
6. Repeat with 8 more sheets of Fillo dough, buttering each layer. Drizzle any remaining butter on the top. Fold down excess Fillo dough from around the edge of the Dutch oven.
7. Cut into diamond-shaped pieces without cutting through the bottom layer of Fillo dough. Place the lid on the Dutch oven.
8. Bake at 350Â°F for 35-40 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from heat and pour chilled syrup over the Baklava. Finish cutting through the bottom layer of Fillo. Serve.
