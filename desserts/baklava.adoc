Baklava is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert made with layers of flaky Fillo dough, butter, and a sweet nut filling, all soaked in a rich honey syrup. This version is cooked in a Dutch oven, giving it a unique twist on the classic preparation method.

== Ingredients

* 24 sheets Fillo (phylo) dough (thaw in fridge overnight, do not leave on counter)
* 1 cup butter, melted
* 1 1/2 cups finely chopped pecans
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon

=== Lemon Honey Syrup
* 1 1/2 cups sugar
* 3/4 cup water
* 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon honey

== Instructions

. Preheat oven to 350°F.
. Prepare honey syrup by combining all syrup ingredients and bringing to a boil. Boil for 1 minute, then chill.
. Melt butter. Mix pecans, sugar, and cinnamon; set aside.
. Butter the bottom of a 12-inch Dutch oven generously. Lay 1 sheet of Fillo dough in the bottom of the Dutch oven, keeping the remaining dough covered with a damp cloth. Using a pastry brush, butter the top, beginning at the edges and working towards the center. Repeat this step until 8 sheets of Fillo dough are layered in the Dutch oven, buttering each layer.
. Sprinkle 1/2 of the nut mixture evenly over the Fillo dough.
. Place 8 more sheets of Fillo dough on top of the nut mixture, buttering between each layer. Sprinkle the remaining nut mixture on top.
. Repeat with 8 more sheets of Fillo dough, buttering each layer. Drizzle any remaining butter on the top. Fold down excess Fillo dough from around the edge of the Dutch oven.
. Cut into diamond-shaped pieces without cutting through the bottom layer of Fillo dough. Place the lid on the Dutch oven.
. Bake at 350°F for 35-40 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from heat and pour chilled syrup over the Baklava. Finish cutting through the bottom layer of Fillo. Serve.
