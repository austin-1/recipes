== Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups flour, spooned and leveled
* 3 tablespoons powdered sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/4 cups dairy milk
* 4 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
* 1 large egg yolk
* 3 large egg whites
* 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
* Syrup and powdered sugar for serving

== Instructions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, powdered sugar, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a second bowl, stir together the milk, melted butter, almond extract, and egg yolk.
3. In a third bowl, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar for 3-4 minutes until stiff peaks form.
4. Stir the milk mixture into the dry ingredients until just combined, leaving a few lumps.
5. Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the batter until just incorporated, being careful not to overmix.
6. Preheat a deep skillet with a lid over low heat. Spray the inside of 3-inch baking rings with nonstick spray and place them in the preheating pan.
7. Fill each ring halfway full with batter. Place the lid on the pan and allow to cook for 5 minutes.
8. Slide a spatula underneath the pancake and ring, and use tongs to quickly flip it over. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until golden brown.
9. Serve immediately topped with syrup and powdered sugar.
