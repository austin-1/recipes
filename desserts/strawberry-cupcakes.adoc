== Ingredients

=== Cupcakes
* 1 tablespoon freeze-dried strawberry powder
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/3 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 cup pureed strawberry
* 1/8 cup buttermilk (room temperature)
* 1/8 cup vegetable oil
* 1 large egg (room temperature)
* 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

=== Frosting
* 1/3 cup cream cheese (room temperature)
* 1/3 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)
* 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/3 cup powdered sugar
* 1 tablespoon freeze-dried strawberry powder

== Instructions

. Prepare the strawberry powder:
  * Add 1 oz of freeze-dried strawberries to a food processor and process until a powder forms. This should yield about 1/2 cup. Use 1 tablespoon for the cupcake batter and the remaining for the strawberry cream cheese frosting.

. Make the cupcakes:
  1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F and line a muffin pan with cupcake liners.
  2. In a small mixing bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of strawberry powder, flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Whisk to distribute evenly.
  3. In the same food processor used for the strawberries, puree fresh strawberries. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the strawberry puree, buttermilk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract. Whisk until smooth.
  4. Fold the flour mixture into the wet ingredients until just combined.
  5. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin pan, filling each cavity with about 1/4 cup of batter.
  6. Bake on the middle oven rack for 16-17 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the pan briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

. Make the frosting:
  1. Ensure the cream cheese and butter are at room temperature. Cut into small cubes if necessary.
  2. In a stand mixer, add the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla extract. Start mixing on medium-low and increase to medium-high until well combined.
  3. Gradually add the powdered sugar and remaining strawberry powder while mixing on low. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy.
  4. Using a pastry bag with a tip of your choice, fill with the frosting and apply to the cooled cupcakes.
