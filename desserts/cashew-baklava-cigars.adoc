== Ingredients

=== Lemon Syrup
* 1 cup sugar
* Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup water

=== Filling
* 3/4 cup whole cashews, lightly toasted
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* Pinch ground cardamom
* Pinch cayenne
* Pinch ground cinnamon
* Pinch salt
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

=== Dough
* 3 sheets phyllo, thawed
* 5 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled

== Instructions

1. **Make the Lemon Syrup:**
   * Combine the sugar with 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan over high heat and bring to a boil.
   * Continue boiling, whisking, until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 2 minutes. 
   * Add the lemon zest and juice, cover, and let stand off the heat for 15 minutes.
   * Strain out and discard the zest. Reserve the syrup.

2. **Prepare the Filling:**
   * Combine the cashews, brown sugar, cardamom, cayenne, cinnamon, salt, and melted butter in a food processor.
   * Pulse until the mixture is finely ground to a uniform texture.

3. **Assemble the Baklava Cigars:**
   * Lay out one sheet of phyllo with a short side closest to you and brush with butter. 
   * Place another sheet on top and brush with butter. Repeat with the third sheet of phyllo. 
   * Slice the rectangle lengthwise into 2 halves.
   * Spoon 2 tablespoons of the filling in a straight line along the bottom edge of one of the phyllo rectangle stacks.
   * Roll several turns into a cigar shape, slice the cigar free, and place in a baking dish.
   * Repeat this process with the remaining filling. When all the cigars are assembled, brush with more butter.

4. **Bake:**
   * Preheat the oven to 350Â°F, with a rack in the middle.
   * Bake until browned and crisp, 30 to 35 minutes.
   * Drizzle with about 1/4 cup of the lemon syrup. Let cool completely before serving.
