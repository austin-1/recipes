== Ingredients
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 6 (6 ounce) fillets red snapper
* Salt, to taste

== Instructions
. On a large piece of wax paper, mix together the paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, onion powder, thyme, basil, garlic powder, and oregano.
. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter with the olive oil. Brush both sides of the snapper fillets with the butter mixture, reserving the remaining butter mixture. Coat both sides of the fillets with the seasoning mixture.
. Heat a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles on the surface. Drizzle half of the remaining butter-oil mixture on one side of the fish fillets.
. Place the fillets, butter side down, in the hot skillet. Cook over high heat until the fish is deeply browned, about 5 minutes.
. Drizzle the remaining butter-oil mixture over the fish and flip the fillets over. Cook until the fish is browned and flakes easily when tested with a fork, about 5 minutes more.
. Season to taste with salt and serve immediately.
