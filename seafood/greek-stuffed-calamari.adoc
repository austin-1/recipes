== Instructions
. Prepare Calamari:
.. Rinse the calamari. If the calamari has heads or tentacles, chop them up and add to the pot with the onion.
. Cook Filling:
.. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot. Add the chopped onion and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring regularly until soft and translucent.
.. Add the grated carrot and cook for 2-3 more minutes.
.. Stir in the grated tomato, dill, parsley, and oregano, cooking for 2-3 minutes.
.. Add the rice and stir. After 1-2 minutes, add the wine and passata, followed by salt, pepper, and lemon zest. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to cool.
. Preheat Oven:
.. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).
. Prepare Baking Dish:
.. Grease the bottom of a 13 x 9 inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.
. Stuff Calamari:
.. Using a small spoon, fill each calamari tube about halfway with the rice mixture. Close the opening with a toothpick to keep the filling inside.
.. Place the stuffed calamari in the prepared baking dish. If there is any leftover filling, add it to the baking dish around the calamari.
. Bake:
.. In a small bowl, mix together the passata and water. Pour this over the stuffed calamari, then drizzle the remaining olive oil on top.
.. Cover the dish and bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 30 minutes.
.. Remove the cover and bake for an additional 15 minutes, adding more water if needed.
. Serve:
.. Serve the stuffed calamari with some of the sauce and rice from the baking pan.
