== Ingredients
* 12 oz crawfish tail meat, cooked
* 4 ears of corn, kernels removed (or 3 cups frozen corn)
* 1 large potato, peeled and diced
* 1 red bell pepper, diced
* 1 green bell pepper, diced
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 cups vegetable broth
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a bit of heat)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped, for garnish
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

== Instructions
. *Prepare the Vegetables:*
.. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper. Cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.

. *Make the Base:*
.. Add the butter to the pot and let it melt. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat evenly. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid burning the flour. Gradually add the vegetable broth, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer.

. *Add the Corn and Potatoes:*
.. Add the corn kernels and diced potatoes to the pot. Season with smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.

. *Finish the Chowder:*
.. Stir in the heavy cream and bring the mixture back to a gentle simmer. Add the crawfish tail meat and cook for another 5 minutes until the crawfish is heated through. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

. *Serve:*
.. Ladle the chowder into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro.

== Notes
* This chowder pairs well with crusty bread or a fresh salad for a complete meal.
* Adjust the cayenne pepper to your preferred level of heat, or omit it for a milder chowder.
