== Instructions

. Prepare Shrimp Cake Mixture:
.. Remove and discard shrimp tails. Finely chop shrimp using a sharp chef's knife or pulse in a food processor until finely chopped.
.. Place shrimp in a bowl, along with egg, 3/4 cup panko, bell pepper, shallots, cilantro, mayonnaise, lime juice, fish sauce, Thai sweet chili sauce, and chili-garlic sauce. Mix until well-combined.
.. Cover and refrigerate for 10 minutes.

. Prepare Chili Aioli:
.. While the shrimp mixture chills, combine all aioli ingredients in a small bowl and stir with a whisk until well-combined. Set aside.

. Form and Coat Shrimp Cakes:
.. Place remaining 3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs on a large rimmed plate. Remove shrimp mixture from the fridge and use a 1/3 cup measure to carefully form mixture into 8 uniform patties; place on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
.. Coat each patty in panko breadcrumbs until well-coated. Place coated shrimp cakes back on the parchment-lined baking sheet.

. Cook Shrimp Cakes:
.. Heat 2 Tbsp. of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add 4 shrimp cakes, evenly spacing them apart. Cook for 3 minutes, then carefully flip with a spatula and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes.
.. Place cooked cakes on a plate, add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil, and repeat the process with the last 4 cakes.

. Serve:
.. Serve cakes hot with Chili Aioli and fresh herbs, if desired.
