== Ingredients
* 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 1 whole (3-pound) red snapper, cleaned and scaled
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 lemon, halved
* 1/2 small onion, chopped
* 1/2 small fennel bulb, chopped
* 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
* 1 tablespoon chopped fennel fronds
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary leaves
* 1 small garlic clove, minced

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
. Line a heavy large baking sheet with foil and lightly oil the foil with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Place the red snapper on the prepared foil.
. Season the cavity of the fish with salt and pepper. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 lemon inside the fish cavity. Stuff the cavity with the chopped onion, fennel, and rosemary sprigs.
. Bake the fish in the preheated oven until it is just cooked through at the bone, about 40 minutes.
. While the fish is baking, prepare the lemon herb sauce. Squeeze the juice from the remaining 1/2 lemon into a small bowl. Whisk in the chopped fennel fronds, chopped rosemary leaves, and minced garlic. Gradually whisk in the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Season the sauce to taste with salt and pepper.
. Once the fish is cooked, use a sharp knife to separate the top two fillets from the backbone. Use a metal spatula to transfer the top fillets to a plate.
. Carefully lift the fish backbone from the bottom fillets (the backbone and head should come off easily) and discard. Use the spatula to transfer the remaining fillets to plates.
. Season the fillets with additional salt and pepper if needed. Drizzle the prepared lemon herb sauce over the fish fillets before serving.

== Serving Suggestions
Serve the baked red snapper with roasted vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete and delicious meal.
