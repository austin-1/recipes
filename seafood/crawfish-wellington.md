# Crawfish Wellington

[&larrhk; Back to Seafood Recipes](./README.md)

Though at first it seems an odd tip of the hat to familiar Beef Wellington, this dish is a wonderful variation spotlighting Louisiana's most versatile shellfish. A filling of crawfish tails, mushrooms, and scallop mousse is sealed in puff pastry and served in a pool of White Butter Sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (1/2 pound) Boiled Crawfish Tails, cut in half
- 2 cups Scallop Mousse (recipe below)
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- 4 cups sliced fresh mushrooms, about 1/2 pound
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 pounds fresh or good-quality frozen puff pastry
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 3/4 cup White Butter Sauce (recipe below)
- 6 parsley sprigs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Mix the crawfish, scallop mousse, and brandy in a bowl, and set aside.
3. In a pan over high heat, sauté the mushrooms until the moisture in them has evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Roll out the puff pastry to ½ inch thick and cut 6 rectangles, each 7 by 5 inches.
5. Center 1 teaspoon of the sautéed mushrooms on each rectangle, then top with about ½ cup of the crawfish mixture. Cover with another teaspoon of the mushrooms.
6. Brush all the exposed puff pastry with beaten egg, fold over the edges, and seal by pinching lightly. Decorate with any excess pastry cut into interesting shapes. Brush all the surfaces with egg and place the pastries on a sheet pan.
7. Bake in the oven for 22 minutes, until the pastry turns golden brown.
8. When ready to serve, ladle 2 tablespoons of white butter sauce on each of 6 dinner plates. Center the Wellington shells on the sauce, garnish with the parsley sprigs, and serve immediately.

## Scallop Mousse

**Yields 2 cups**

### Ingredients

- 1.5 pounds medium bay scallops, removed from shell (with coral removed), drained
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt and white pepper
- 4 tablespoons finely chopped carrots
- 4 tablespoons finely chopped leeks
- 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- 1 pinch of cayenne pepper
- 1/2 cup bread crumbs, approximately

### Instructions

1. Place the scallops in a blender and blend until light and smooth.
2. Add the eggs and heavy cream, then season to taste with salt and white pepper. Blend for 2 minutes more at high speed.
3. While continuing to blend, add the carrots, leeks, parsley, and cayenne. Blend until a smooth mousse is achieved, thickening as needed with the breadcrumbs.

## White Butter Sauce

**Yields 2 cups**

### Ingredients

- 1/8 cup chopped shallots
- 1/4 teaspoon coarse white pepper
- 1 1/2 cups dry white wine
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
- Salt

### Instructions

1. Combine the shallots, white pepper, and wine in a pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated.
2. Add the cream and reduce to one-third of its original volume.
3. Remove from the heat and add the butter, small amounts at a time, whipping with a whisk until the butter is completely mixed with the cream. (The sauce will separate if this is done over heat.)
4. Season to taste with salt.

**Note:** White butter sauce cannot be stored, but any leftovers are good over a sophisticated salad.
