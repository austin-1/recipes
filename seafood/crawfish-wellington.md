# Crawfish Wellington

[&larrhk; Back to Seafood Recipes](./README.md)

Though at first it seems an odd tip of the hat to familiar Beef Wellington, this dish is a wonderful variation spotlighting Louisiana's most versatile shellfish. A filling of crawfish tails, mushrooms, and scallop mousse is sealed in puff pastry and served in a pool of White Butter Sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (1/4 pound) Boiled Crawfish Tails, cut in half
- 1 cup Scallop Mousse (recipe below)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons brandy
- 2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms, about 1/4 pound
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 sheets frozen puff pastry (1.1 pound box)
- 1 egg, beaten
- 3/8 cup White Butter Sauce (recipe below)
- 3 parsley sprigs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Mix the crawfish, scallop mousse, and brandy in a bowl, and set aside.
3. In a pan over high heat, sauté the mushrooms until the moisture in them has evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Roll out each puff pastry sheet to thaw, placing one of the sheets on a sheet pan topped with a silicone baking mat.
5. Center half of the sautéed mushrooms on a sheet of puff pastry, then top with the crawfish mixture. Cover with another 1/2 teaspoon of the mushrooms. Be sure to leave about an inch of space on all sides.
6. Cover the filling with the other puff pastry sheet and press down on sides to seal. Cut 3 slits diagonally along the top to vent. Brush all the surfaces with egg.
7. Bake in the oven for 30 minutes, or until the pastry turns golden brown.
8. When ready to serve, ladle 1 tablespoon of white butter sauce on each of 3 dinner plates. Center the Wellington shells on the sauce, garnish with the parsley sprigs, and serve immediately.

## Scallop Mousse

**Yields 1 cup**

### Ingredients

- 3/4 pound medium bay scallops, removed from shell (with coral removed), drained
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and white pepper
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped carrots
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped leeks
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
- A small pinch of cayenne pepper
- 1 cup panko bread crumbs, approximately

### Instructions

1. Place the scallops in a blender and blend until light and smooth.
2. Add the eggs and heavy cream, then season to taste with salt and white pepper. Blend for 2 minutes more at high speed.
3. While continuing to blend, add the carrots, leeks, parsley, and cayenne. Blend until a smooth mousse is achieved, thickening as needed with the breadcrumbs.

## White Butter Sauce

**Yields 1 cup**

### Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon chopped shallots
- 1/8 teaspoon coarse white pepper
- 3/4 cup dry white wine
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter
- Salt

### Instructions

1. Combine the shallots, white pepper, and wine in a pot. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid has almost evaporated.
2. Add the cream and reduce to one-third of its original volume.
3. Remove from the heat and add the butter, small amounts at a time, whipping with a whisk until the butter is completely mixed with the cream. (The sauce will separate if this is done over heat.)
4. Season to taste with salt.
