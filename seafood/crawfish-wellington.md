# Crawfish Wellington

Though at first it seems an odd tip of the hat to familiar Beef Wellington, this dish is a wonderful variation spotlighting Louisiana's most versatile shellfish. A filling of crawfish tails, mushrooms, and scallop mousse is sealed in puff pastry and served in a pool of White Butter Sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (1/2 pound) Boiled Crawfish Tails, cut in half
- 2 cups Scallop Mousse (recipe below)
- 1 tablespoon brandy
- 4 cups sliced fresh mushrooms, about 1/2 pound
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 pounds fresh or good-quality frozen puff pastry
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 3/4 cup White Butter Sauce (recipe below)
- 6 parsley sprigs

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. Mix the crawfish, scallop mousse, and brandy in a bowl, and set aside.
3. In a pan over high heat, sauté the mushrooms until the moisture in them has evaporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
4. Roll out the puff pastry to ½ inch thick and cut 6 rectangles, each 7 by 5 inches.
5. Center 1 teaspoon of the sautéed mushrooms on each rectangle, then top with about ½ cup of the crawfish mixture. Cover with another teaspoon of the mushrooms.
6. Brush all the exposed puff pastry with beaten egg, fold over the edges, and seal by pinching lightly. Decorate with any excess pastry cut into interesting shapes. Brush all the surfaces with egg and place the pastries on a sheet pan.
7. Bake in the oven for 22 minutes, until the pastry turns golden brown.
8. When ready to serve, ladle 2 tablespoons of white butter sauce on each of 6 dinner plates. Center the Wellington shells on the sauce, garnish with the parsley sprigs, and serve immediately.
