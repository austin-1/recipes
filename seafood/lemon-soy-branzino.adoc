== Ingredients
* 1 16 oz. whole branzino (scaled, cleaned, and gutted)
* 1 1/3 tablespoons melted butter
* 2/3 tablespoon soy sauce
* Juice and zest of 1/2 a lemon (plus 1 additional lemon, sliced into 9 rounds)
* 1/3 tablespoon parsley, chopped (plus more for garnish)
* Salt, to taste
* 1 sprig thyme
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
. In a bowl, mix the melted butter with the soy sauce, juice and zest of 1/2 a lemon, and 1 tablespoon of chopped parsley.
. Season the cavities of the branzino with salt. Stuff each cavity with 3 lemon rounds and a sprig of thyme.
. In a large, nonstick, ovenproof skillet, heat the olive oil over high heat until shimmering. Add the branzino and cook until the skin is browned and crisp, about 2 minutes per side. You may need to do this in batches.
. Transfer the seared fish to a large rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the butter mixture, season with more salt to taste, and roast in the preheated oven for 9 minutes.
. Finish the fish under the broiler for 1-2 minutes, keeping an eye on it to prevent burning.
. Garnish with more chopped parsley and serve.

== Notes
* This dish pairs well with steamed vegetables or a simple side salad.
