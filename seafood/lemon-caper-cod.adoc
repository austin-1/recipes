link:./README.me[&larrhk; Back to Seafood Recipes]

Thick-cut cod is pan-seared in a mixture of olive oil and butter to produce a golden brown crust, then served with a lemon, parsley, and caper sauce. This simple and healthy dish makes for a perfect weeknight meal.

== Ingredients

*Cod Fillets:*
* 0.75 lb thick cut cod fillet, cut into 4-5 pieces
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided (1 tbsp for the fish and 1 tbsp for the sauce)
* 1-1.5 tablespoons olive oil
* 0.5 tablespoon unsalted butter

*Seasoned Flour:*
* 0.25 cup all-purpose flour
* 0.5 teaspoon cumin
* 0.5 teaspoon paprika
* Dash of cayenne powder
* 0.5 teaspoon dried thyme
* 0.5 teaspoon kosher salt
* 0.13 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

*Sauce:*
* 2.5 medium cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 tablespoon capers
* 0.25 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine
* 0.25 cup chopped fresh parsley
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

== Instructions
. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of lemon juice over the cod fillets and set them aside while you prepare the rest of the ingredients. Allow the lemon juice to sit on the cod for at least 15 minutes, up to 30 minutes.
. In a shallow bowl, mix together all the seasoned flour ingredients. Pat the fish dry and dredge in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.
. Heat 1-1.5 tablespoons of olive oil and the butter in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until the pan is hot and the oil is shimmering. Add the cod and cook for 5-6 minutes on the first side. The fish will release from the pan once it’s ready to turn. Once it achieves a deep, golden brown color, flip the fish.
. Continue cooking the fish on the other side until it is browned and cooked through, about another 5-6 minutes. Add more olive oil if needed.
. Remove the fish to a serving dish and let it rest while you make the sauce.
. In the same pan, add the garlic and capers, cooking and stirring constantly for about 30 seconds. Add the vermouth or wine to deglaze the pan. Bring it to a boil and scrape up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Boil for 1 minute, then add the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice and the parsley. Stir to combine and bring to a quick boil.
. Immediately pour the sauce over the fish and serve.

== Notes
* Thick-cut cod is often called captain's cut cod. If you can't find thick-cut cod, you can use thinner pieces—just reduce the cooking time. Try to find pieces of uniform thickness so they cook evenly.
* This recipe pairs well with simple cooked orzo tossed with olive oil and a steamed vegetable.
