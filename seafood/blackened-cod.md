## Ingredients

- 4 cod fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons [blackened seasoning](../sauces-seasonings/blackened-seasoning.md)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), sliced
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 zucchini, sliced
- 3 celery stalks, sliced
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

## Instructions

1. Rinse and pat dry the cod fillets. Rub each fillet with the blackened seasoning, ensuring they are well coated.
2. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Sear the cod fillets for 1-2 minutes on each side until the seasoning forms a crust. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add the sliced bell peppers, onion, garlic, zucchini, and celery. Saut√© until vegetables begin to soften, about 5-7 minutes.
4. Stir in the drained diced tomatoes, thyme, smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Return the seared cod fillets to the pan, nestling them into the vegetable mixture. Cover and simmer on low heat for 10-12 minutes or until the cod is flaky and the vegetables are tender.
6. Once done, carefully remove the cod fillets from the pan and plate them with the cooked vegetables.
7. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side.
