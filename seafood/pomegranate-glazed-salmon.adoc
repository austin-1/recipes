== Ingredients

*For the Asparagus Salad:*
* 1 pound asparagus
* 1 orange
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* 1 cup frozen lima beans, defrosted
* 1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts, crushed
* 1/4 cup fresh mint, minced
* 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, minced
* 2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias up to the pale greens
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

*For the Pomegranate-Glazed Salmon:*
* Four 3- to 5-ounce skin-on salmon fillets, thoroughly dried with a paper towel
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* Pomegranate Glaze (recipe below)

*For the Pomegranate Glaze:*
* 1/2 cup pomegranate juice
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

== Instructions

*Prepare the Asparagus Salad:*
. Bring a pot of water to a boil; prepare an ice water bath. Blanch the asparagus in the boiling water for about 2-3 minutes, then transfer to the ice water to stop the cooking process. Drain, then cut the asparagus spears on the bias into thirds.
. Zest the orange, then remove and discard the peel. Cut the flesh into segments and squeeze the juice from the remaining membranes into a large bowl.
. Add the vinegar, mustard, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to the bowl with the orange juice; whisk together. Add the orange zest and segments, asparagus, lima beans, hazelnuts, mint, parsley, and scallions. Toss to combine and season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.

*Prepare the Pomegranate Glaze:*
. In a small saucepan, whisk together the pomegranate juice, honey, brown sugar, mustard, cornstarch, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.

*Cook the Salmon:*
. Position an oven rack in the second position from the top and preheat the oven to broil.
. Heat a nonstick ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Season all sides of the salmon with salt and pepper. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil to the skillet.
. Place the salmon fillets in the skillet, skin-side down, and cook for 1 minute.
. Set aside some of the pomegranate glaze in a separate bowl for serving. Brush the salmon liberally with the remaining glaze, being careful not to let too much drip down as the glaze can burn and hinder the crisping of the skin.
. Transfer the skillet to the oven and broil until the glaze is caramelized and the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 125Â°F, about 4 to 5 minutes.

*Serve:*
. Serve the salmon fillets over the asparagus salad with a couple of smears of the reserved pomegranate glaze on the side. Enjoy!
