link:./README.md[&larrhk; Back to Seafood Recipes]

The collar of salmon is full of flavorful meat that stays succulent when broiled. This dish pairs the rich taste of salmon collars with a bold soy-ginger sauce, making it a delicious and easy meal. Salmon fillets can be used as a substitute if collars are unavailable.

== Ingredients
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
* 1 1/4 teaspoons granulated sugar
* 4 (8-ounce) sockeye salmon collars (or salmon fillets)
* 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
* 4 large radishes, grated on large holes of a box grater
* 1 cup packed shredded green cabbage
* 1 lime, quartered

== Instructions
. Whisk together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, grated ginger, and granulated sugar in a small bowl. Measure 2 tablespoons of the soy-ginger sauce into a separate small bowl for brushing the salmon; reserve the remaining sauce for serving.
. Brush the salmon collars all over with the 2 tablespoons of sauce and sprinkle evenly with salt. Chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes.
. Preheat the oven to broil with the rack 6 to 8 inches from the heat source. Arrange the salmon collars, skin side up, on a large rimmed baking sheet. Broil in the preheated oven until the skin is lightly charred, about 5 minutes. Flip the salmon and broil until the flesh just flakes with a fork, about 3 minutes.
. Place the broiled salmon collars on plates. Toss the grated radishes and shredded cabbage together in a bowl, then divide the mixture among the plates with the salmon. Drizzle with some of the reserved soy-ginger sauce and serve with lime quarters.

== Make Ahead
* The soy-ginger sauce can be prepared and refrigerated up to 3 days in advance.

== Serving Suggestions
* Serve this dish with steamed rice or a fresh salad for a complete meal.
