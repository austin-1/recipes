== Ingredients
* 1 lb (16 oz) cavatappi pasta
* 1 lb (16 oz) cooked crawfish tails
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 3 cups milk
* 2 teaspoons Better Than Boullon lobster base
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
* 1 cup shredded Gruyere cheese
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
* 1 tablespoon melted butter (for breadcrumbs)
* Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish

== Instructions
. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish and set it aside.
. Cook the cavatappi pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until the roux becomes lightly golden brown.
. Gradually pour in the milk, whisking continuously to prevent lumps from forming. Cook the mixture for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until it thickens slightly.
. Stir in the lobster base, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper into the saucepan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring until well combined.
. Reduce the heat to low and gradually add the shredded cheddar, Gruyere, and Parmesan cheese to the sauce, stirring until melted and smooth.
. Add the cooked cavatappi pasta and crawfish tails to the cheese sauce, stirring until everything is well coated.
. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.
. In a small bowl, mix together the breadcrumbs with the melted butter. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture evenly over the top of the mac and cheese.
. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese sauce is bubbly.
. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.
. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.
