# Sapelo Island Oyster Stuffing

A refined version of the classic Southern oyster dressing, this recipe incorporates fresh herbs, artisan bread, and a hint of spice to complement the briny oysters, offering a sophisticated yet comforting side dish that's perfect for holiday gatherings.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 cups chopped celery
- 2 green bell peppers, chopped
- 1 small bunch green onions, chopped (about 1 cup)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 quart fresh oysters, drained (reserve the liquid)
- 3 cups crumbled cornbread (homemade or store-bought)
- 4 cups crumbled soft French bread or artisan bread (such as sourdough)
- 1 cup chicken or vegetable stock
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (optional, for added brightness)
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for a hint of smoky flavor)

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9" x 13" baking dish or two 1/2-quart casseroles with butter or non-stick spray.
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped celery, bell peppers, green onions, parsley, thyme, bay leaf, salt, and black pepper. Sauté the mixture until the vegetables are soft, about 8-10 minutes. Remove the bay leaf and discard.
3. Gently fold in the drained oysters and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, just until the oyster edges begin to curl. Be careful not to overcook the oysters.
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the crumbled cornbread and French bread. Pour the oyster mixture over the bread and toss gently to combine.
5. Gradually add the reserved oyster liquid and enough chicken or vegetable stock to moisten the stuffing to your liking. Add lemon juice and smoked paprika if using, and toss to combine.
6. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish. Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and slightly crispy.
7. Serve warm as a side dish, or use it to stuff a turkey or chicken for a more traditional presentation.

## Notes
- This stuffing pairs wonderfully with roasted poultry or as a standalone dish.
- The lemon juice adds a touch of brightness that complements the oysters, while the smoked paprika introduces a subtle smokiness.
- The stuffing can be prepared ahead of time and baked just before serving. Store covered in the refrigerator for up to one day before baking.
