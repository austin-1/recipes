link:./README.me[&larrhk; Back to Seafood Recipes]

Gluten-free and keto-friendly crab cakes made with almond flour instead of breadcrumbs. These crab cakes are wonderfully crispy and delicious, perfect as an appetizer or main course.

== Ingredients
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 8 oz fresh lump crabmeat, gently picked through and shells removed
* 1 tablespoon mayonnaise
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic (or 1 teaspoon garlic powder)
* 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
* 1/2 cup blanched finely ground almond flour
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 tablespoons olive oil

== Instructions
. In a medium bowl, lightly whisk the egg with a fork. Add the crabmeat and mix well, pressing on the crabmeat with the fork to break up any large pieces.
. Stir in the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, garlic, kosher salt, thyme, and cayenne pepper until well combined.
. Add the chopped parsley and almond flour, mixing until evenly incorporated.
. Use a 1/4-cup scoop to portion out six equal portions of the mixture. Use your hands to form the portions into six 1/2-inch-thick patties.
. Place the crab cakes on a platter lined with wax paper. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour to help them firm up.
. Heat the butter and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat for about 3 minutes.
. Add the crab cakes to the skillet and cook for about 4 minutes without moving them, until the bottoms are browned.
. Carefully flip the crab cakes using two spatulas. Gently press on the tops to slightly flatten, then cook on the other side until browned, about 3-4 more minutes.
. Remove the crab cakes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil, then serve.

== Notes
* The fresher the crabmeat, the better the crab cakes will taste.
* If fresh garlic is unavailable, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder can be used instead.
* It's essential to chill the crab cakes for at least an hour before frying to help them hold their shape and prevent falling apart during cooking.
