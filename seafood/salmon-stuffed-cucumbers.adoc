= Salmon Stuffed Cucumbers with Cream Cheese
These refreshing salmon stuffed cucumber appetizers are quick and easy to make with just six common ingredients. Perfect for a healthy snack or party appetizer!

== Ingredients
* 1 lb cucumber (about 1 foot-long cucumber)
* 2 oz cream cheese, softened and cut into cubes
* 2 tbsp sour cream
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 5 oz Chicken of the Sea Pink Salmon (or any canned salmon)
* 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
* Sea salt, to taste (optional)
* Black pepper, to taste (optional)

== Instructions

*Prepare the Cucumbers:*
. Cut the cucumber in half lengthwise. Then, cut crosswise into shorter pieces, about 3 inches (8 cm) long.
. Use a spoon to scoop out the center of each cucumber piece, forming a well, while leaving edges on all sides. The cucumbers will release juices as you do this, so pat them dry with paper towels afterward.

*Make the Filling:*
. In a blender or food processor, blend together the cream cheese, sour cream, and minced garlic until smooth.
. Fold in the salmon and fresh dill. (You can do this in a bowl or right in the blender, but don't blend to maintain a chunky texture.) If desired, season with a little sea salt and black pepper to taste.

*Assemble the Appetizers:*
. Scoop the salmon mixture into the cucumber boats.
. Garnish with additional dill if desired.
