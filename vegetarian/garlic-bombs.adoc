Roasted Garlic Bombs are easy to make and perfect for adding a burst of flavor to your dishes. Roast a batch and freeze them for quick use in weeknight meals.

== Ingredients
* 6 heads of garlic (larger heads work best)
* 3-4 tablespoons olive oil
* Aluminum foil

== Instructions
. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
. Peel the outer skin off each head of garlic, leaving the inner skins around each clove intact.
. Slice about 1/4 inch off the top of each garlic head, exposing the tops of the cloves inside.
. Place the garlic heads upright on a piece of aluminum foil (two heads per piece of foil works well).
. Drizzle olive oil over the tops of the garlic heads until they are fully saturated, using about 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of oil per head.
. Cinch the aluminum foil at the top and sides to create a pouch. Place the pouches on a baking sheet.
. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the garlic is tender.
. Let the garlic cool slightly, then pinch each clove out of its skin.
. (Optional) Wrap 7-8 cloves in plastic wrap and place the wrapped clusters in a large sandwich bag. Repeat with the remaining garlic and store the bag in the freezer. Use one “roasted garlic bomb” as needed.
