This handy Air Fryer Zucchini Fritters recipe is a fantastic way to get your kids to eat their veggies without any resistance! Crispy, flavorful, and nutritious, these zucchini cakes utilize the power of shredded zucchini for a filling and delicious snack or side.

== Ingredients
* 2 medium zucchini
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg
* 1/3 cup flour (or almond flour as a substitute)
* 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* 1 green onion, finely sliced
* Sour cream and additional green onion for garnish (optional)

== Instructions
. Shred the zucchini with a grater into a strainer placed over a towel. Add the salt to the zucchini and toss to coat. Let the zucchini sit with the salt to remove excess water.
. While the zucchini is resting, combine the egg, flour, Parmesan cheese, baking powder, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and sliced green onion in a large bowl.
. Dry the zucchini with a towel, then add it to the bowl with the other ingredients and toss to combine thoroughly.
. Preheat the air fryer to 375°F (190°C). Lightly spray the air fryer basket with oil to prevent sticking.
. Form the zucchini mixture into cakes (about the size of burgers) and place them in the air fryer. Air fry the fritters for 10 minutes, then flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes.
. Serve topped with sour cream and sliced green onion, if desired.
