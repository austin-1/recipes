## Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 cups (300 g) diced sweet potatoes, cut into ½-in (12-mm) pieces
- ½ cup (70 g) whole-wheat flour
- 3/4 cup (105 g) all-purpose flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- ⅔ cup (160 ml) whole milk
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 3 oz (85 g) feta cheese
- 2 Tbsp chopped fresh chives
- 1/4 cup (8 g) grated Parmesan cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the sweet potatoes and sauté until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp water, cover, and let steam until the sweet potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 3 minutes.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together both flours, the baking powder, salt, and paprika. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour the milk and egg into the center. Whisk together the liquid ingredients, then slowly whisk in the dry ingredients until the dough just comes together (be careful not to overmix). Using a spatula, fold in the sweet potatoes, feta, and chives.
4. Fill each muffin liner three-fourths full and sprinkle with the Parmesan and a pinch of pepper.
5. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Serve warm or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
