== Instructions
. Prepare the Quinoa:
.. Rinse the quinoa under cold water.
.. In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water or vegetable broth to a boil.
.. Add the quinoa, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork and set aside.

.. Add the chopped mushroom stems, bell pepper, red onion, zucchini, and garlic. Sauté until the vegetables are tender, about 5-7 minutes.
.. Season with salt and pepper.

. Mix the Stuffing:
.. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, sautéed vegetables, chopped parsley, and basil. Mix well.

. Stuff the Mushrooms:
.. Fill each mushroom cap with the quinoa and vegetable mixture.
.. Sprinkle the tops with grated mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs.

. Cook in Handi Pots:
.. Divide the stuffed mushrooms evenly between two handi clay pots, arranging them snugly.
.. Cover the pots with their lids.

. Bake:
