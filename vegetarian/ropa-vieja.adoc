== Ingredients
* 2 cans of jackfruit, cut into 1 1/2 inch strips
* Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
* 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
* 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 1 tbsp cumin
* 1 tbsp dried thyme
* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1 bay leaf
* 6 oz tomato paste
* 1/2 cup vegetable broth
* 1 16-oz can whole peeled tomatoes
* 1/2 cup halved, pitted green olives
* 1/3 cup sliced jarred pimiento peppers
* 1 tbsp white wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup roughly chopped cilantro

== Instructions
. Heat a 6-quart or large Dutch oven (or other heavy-bottomed pot) over medium-high heat. Season the jackfruit strips with salt and pepper, and cook until browned on both sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
. Add the onion and bell peppers to the pot and cook for about 4 minutes, until softened.
. Add the cumin, thyme, oregano, garlic, bay leaf, and tomato paste to the pot. Cook for another 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
. Pour in the vegetable broth and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
. Add the canned tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and let simmer for 2 hours, or until the jackfruit is tender.
. Stir in the olives, pimientos, and vinegar. Cook uncovered for an additional 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt as needed.
. Serve the stew topped with fresh cilantro.
