== Instructions

=== Prepare Rice and Lentils

. Rinse basmati rice and lentils under cold water until the water runs clear. 
. In the rice cooker, add the rinsed rice and lentils.
. Pour in 1 1/2 cups of vegetable stock. 
. Stir the ingredients gently to combine them evenly.
. Close the lid of the rice cooker and set it to the brown rice setting.
. Allow the rice cooker to complete its cooking cycle while you prepare the other ingredients.

=== Prepare Cabbage

. Core the cabbage, then place the cabbage core-side down in a large pot. Fill the pot with boiling water to cover the cabbage and bring to a low simmer.
. After about 3-4 minutes of simmering, start pulling the leaves off one by one, leaving time between each layer to allow the leaves to soften.
. Trim cabbage leaves to a remove frayed pieces, making the largest rectangle possible.
. Set aside cabbage leaves and save all trimmings separately.

=== Prepare Filling

. In a wide pan, heat olive oil and fry the onion and garlic over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to release water, about 3 minutes.
. Add the tomato puree, lemon juice and spices to the remaining 1/2 cup of vegetable stock and mix well.
. When the rice cooker is complete, add the lentils, rice, and remaining vegetable stock. Stir and cover the pan, then simmer for about 15 minutes until all the water is absorbed.
. Transfer filling to a large bowl.
. Place a spoonful of filling on each cabbage leaf piece, forming it into a line in the center and leaving space on both sides. Fold the ends over the filling, then roll the leaf tightly.

=== Prepare Dutch Oven

. Fill a Dutch Oven with 2 cups vegetable stock and set heat to medium high.
. Add the cabbage leaf trimmings to the bottom of the Dutch Oven.
. Place 4-5 cabbage rolls in the center of the Dutch Oven, tightly spaced.
. Fill the remaining space around the cabbage rolls with 1/3 of the tomato wedges and garlic cloves.
. Layer the remaining rolls in the Dutch Oven, alternating the direction with each layer. Continue to add tomato wedges and garlic cloves around the remaining space.
. Top with 3-5 fresh mint leaves.
. Fill the Dutch Oven with the remaining 4 cups of vegetable stock, or until the water line is just below the mint leaves.
. Cover with lid and simmer for 45 minutes.

=== Serve

. Discard mint leaves.
. Use two tongs to grab both ends of the cabbage rolls and quickly transfer onto an adjacent plate.
. Drain excess liquid off plate and garnish with tomatoes and garlic cloves.
. Serve with steak knife and fork.

=== Tips

. Save the excess water from the Dutch Oven as vegetable stock for another recipe.
