== Ingredients
=== For the cabbage leaves
* 1 large green cabbage or 2 medium cabbages

=== For the filling
* 1 large brown onion, finely chopped
* 6 cloves garlic, chopped
* 250g mushrooms, finely chopped
* 2 tbsp tomato puree
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/2 tsp ground allspice
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp ground coriander
* 200g brown, green, or puy lentils (1 cup)
* 200g brown rice (1 cup)
* 250ml vegetable stock (1 cup)
* 1 lemon, juiced
* 2 tbsp olive oil

=== For the pot
* 6 medium tomatoes, wedged
* 1 bulb garlic, peeled and sliced
* 1 litre boiling water (4 cups)
* 2 tsp salt
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 1 tbsp dried mint

== Instructions
. Place the cabbage upside down in a large pot. Use a long, sharp knife to cut around the core, going as deep as you can. Fill the pot with boiling water to cover the cabbage and bring to a low simmer.
. After about 3-4 minutes of simmering, start pulling the leaves off one by one, leaving time between each layer to allow the leaves to soften.
. In a wide pan, heat a little oil and fry the onion and garlic over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to release water, about 3 minutes.
. Add the tomato puree and spices, mix well, then add the lentils, rice, and vegetable stock. Stir and cover the pan, then simmer for about 15 minutes until all the water is absorbed.
. Stir in the lemon juice and olive oil, and season with salt and pepper.
. Cut each cabbage leaf into two or three pieces, making sure to cut around the stem. For small leaves, you can leave them whole but thin out any chunky stems.
. Place a couple of small spoonfuls of filling on each cabbage leaf piece, forming it into a line and leaving space at either end. Fold the ends over the filling, then roll the leaf tightly. Give the roll a little squeeze to secure it.
. Add a layer of leftover cabbage leaves to the bottom of a heavy pot. Line the cabbage rolls up tightly, adding wedges of tomato between any gaps.
. Layer the rolls in the pot, alternating the direction with each layer. Sprinkle slices of garlic between each layer. When all the rolls are in, add any remaining garlic and tomato.
. Mix the water, salt, lemon juice, and dried mint, and pour it over the rolls. Top up with enough water to nearly cover the rolls.
. Place a heavy plate or bowl on top of the rolls, then cover. Bring the water to a simmer and cook for 45 minutes.
. Serve with fresh lemon slices and dairy-free yogurt.
