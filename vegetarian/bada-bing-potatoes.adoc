== Ingredients
* 5 pounds small new potatoes
* 3/4 cup olive oil
* 1/4 cup melted butter
* 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 tablespoon dried basil
* 1 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
* 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary, crumbled
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (for topping)

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).

. Boil the Potatoes:
.. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan of water. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender but still firm, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes.

. Smash the Potatoes:
.. Place the warm potatoes on a greased, rimmed baking sheet. Using the heel of your hand or a small pan, gently flatten each potato, breaking the skin slightly.

. Coat with Seasoning:
.. In a large bowl, mix together the olive oil, melted butter, 1 cup of Parmesan cheese, dried basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper.
.. Add the smashed potatoes to the bowl and toss well to coat them evenly with the seasoning mixture.

. Roast the Potatoes:
.. Return the coated potatoes to the baking sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of space between each potato.
.. Roast in the preheated oven until the potatoes are lightly browned and slightly crispy, about 30 minutes.

. Garnish and Serve:
.. Place the hot potatoes on a large platter and sprinkle with minced fresh parsley and the remaining 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
