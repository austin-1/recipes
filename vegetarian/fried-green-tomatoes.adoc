== Ingredients
* 2 green tomatoes (use 3 if they are smaller)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1 cup Panko crumbs
* 1 cup yellow cornmeal
* Oil mister filled with olive oil or vegetable oil

== Instructions
. Cut the tomatoes into 1/4-inch slices. Pat dry with paper towels and season well with salt and pepper.
. Place the flour in a shallow dish or pie plate.
. Whisk together the eggs and buttermilk in a shallow dish or bowl.
. Combine the Panko crumbs and cornmeal in another shallow dish or pie plate.
. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F (200°C).
. Coat each tomato slice in flour, dip in the egg mixture, and then press into the Panko crumb mixture, ensuring both sides are well-coated. Sprinkle a little more salt on them if desired.
. Mist the air fryer basket with oil and place 4 tomato slices in the basket. Mist the tops with oil as well.
. Air fry for 5 minutes, then flip the tomatoes over, mist with oil, and air fry for an additional 3 minutes, or until crispy and golden brown.
. Serve hot, optionally with a dipping sauce like Comeback sauce.
