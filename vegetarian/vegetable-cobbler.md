## Ingredients

### For the Filling
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium sweet onion, diced
- 1 medium green bell pepper, seeded, deribbed, and diced
- 1 medium zucchini, diced
- 1 cup (90 g) chopped broccoli
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- ½ tsp freshly ground black pepper
- ½ tsp salt
- 10 oz (280 g) cherry tomatoes
- 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup (60 ml) water

### For the Herb Drop Biscuits
- 1½ cups (210 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp freshly ground pepper
- ¼ cup (5 g) fresh herb leaves (such as basil, thyme, chives, rosemary, or sage), finely chopped
- ½ cup (40 g) shredded cheddar cheese
- 6 Tbsp (85 g) cold unsalted butter, cut into large chunks
- ½ cup (120 ml) buttermilk

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, garlic, ½ tsp pepper, and ½ tsp salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 5-7 minutes. Stir in the cherry tomatoes and cook for another 2 minutes.
3. Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir to coat evenly. Add the water and cook, stirring, until the mixture thickens slightly, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer the vegetable mixture to a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
4. To make the herb drop biscuits, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sugar, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp pepper in a large bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the chopped herbs and shredded cheese. Add the buttermilk and stir until just combined.
5. Drop spoonfuls of the biscuit dough over the vegetable filling, covering as much of the surface as possible.
6. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges. Let cool slightly before serving.
