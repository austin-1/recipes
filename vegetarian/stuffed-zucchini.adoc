== Ingredients

. 6 medium zucchini
. 1 bay leaf
. 6 cloves fresh garlic, divided
. 1½ cups chopped onion
. 1½ cups chopped parsley
. 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil
. 1 large tomato, chopped

. 2 cups cooked white beans, drained

== Preparation

. Slice the zucchini in half lengthwise and simmer in 1½ inches of water with the bay leaf until tender, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly and scoop out the insides, leaving a 1/2 inch thick shell. Chop the scooped-out zucchini.
. Coarsely chop 4 cloves of garlic and sauté with the onion and parsley in butter or olive oil until golden and soft, about 5 minutes.
. Stir in the chopped tomato and cook for 1 minute more. Season with thyme, cumin, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Add the chopped zucchini insides.
. Mash the white beans and garbanzo beans until semi-smooth, then stir them into the vegetable mixture.
. Stuff the mixture into the zucchini shells and place them in a buttered baking dish.
. Mince the remaining 2 cloves of garlic and mix with bread crumbs and olive oil. Sprinkle this mixture evenly over the stuffed zucchini.
. Bake at 350°F for 10 to 15 minutes, until the crumbs are golden and crisp, and the dish is heated through.
