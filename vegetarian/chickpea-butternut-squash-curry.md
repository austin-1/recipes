7. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable broth, stirring well to combine, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.
8. Carefully remove the preheated Handi pot from the oven using oven mitts, and transfer the mixture from the pan into the Handi pot.
9. Cover the Handi pot with its lid, and return it to the oven.
10. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the butternut squash is tender.
11. Once cooked, remove the Handi pot from the oven, season with salt and pepper to taste, and add a squeeze of lime juice for brightness.
