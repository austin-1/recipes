A healthy and flavorful twist on the classic egg roll, without the deep-fried wrapper. This dish is naturally vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, paleo, low-carb, and keto-friendly.

== Ingredients
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
* 2 carrots, shredded (about 1 cup)
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 4 cups shredded cabbage (about 1 pound)
* 1 cup sliced mushrooms
* 2 tablespoons tamari (gluten-free soy sauce)
* 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
* Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* Chopped green onions and sesame seeds, for garnish

== Instructions
. Heat the olive oil in a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
. Saut√© the onion, carrots, and celery until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.
. Add the shredded cabbage, mushrooms, tamari, salt, and pepper, along with a splash of water to prevent sticking.
. Cover the skillet and lower the heat. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your preference for crunchiness.
. Stir in the sesame oil once the vegetables are tender to preserve its flavor.
. If desired, add eggs or tofu: Move the cooked vegetables to the edge of the pan to create a well in the center. Add a touch more oil and scramble the protein directly in the pan until cooked through. Stir to combine with the vegetables.
. Season with additional salt and pepper, if needed, then serve warm with a topping of green onions and sesame seeds.
