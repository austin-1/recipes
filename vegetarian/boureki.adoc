== Ingredients
* 3 lbs large zucchini, washed and sliced into thin rounds
* 2 lbs large potatoes, peeled and sliced into thin rounds
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 4-5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 lb ricotta cheese, crumbled (or anthotiro, if available)
* 1/2 lb mizithra cheese, grated (or substitute Parmesan)
* 2 tablespoons fresh mint, minced (or 1 tablespoon dried mint)
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 cup water

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 350°F (170°C).
. In a deep bowl, combine the zucchini, potato, and chopped onion. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of flour, salt, and pepper to taste (keeping in mind that the cheese is salty). Add the grated cheese, mint, garlic, and olive oil. Toss to coat all the slices evenly.
. Grease a 13x9-inch Pyrex baking dish with olive oil. Pour the vegetable and cheese mixture into the dish, spreading it out evenly.
. Press down with the palms of your hands to compact the mixture slightly. Carefully pour 1/4 cup of water over the top.
. Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. If the boureki appears too dry during baking, you can add up to 1/4 cup more water, but be cautious as the zucchini and potatoes will release liquid during baking.
. Allow the boureki to cool for 15 minutes before cutting into portions.
