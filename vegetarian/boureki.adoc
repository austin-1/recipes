== Ingredients
* 5 small zucchini, washed and sliced into thin rounds
* 2 lbs baby potatoes, washed and sliced into thin rounds
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 15 oz ricotta cheese
* 8 oz Parmesan cheese, grated
* 2 tablespoons fresh mint, minced (or 1 tablespoon dried mint)
* 1/4 teaspoon Greek seasoning
* 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon everything bagel seasoning
* 1/2 cup flour
* 1/4 cup vegetable stock

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 350°F (170°C).
. In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic cloves, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, mint, Greek seasoning, black pepper, salt, everything bagel seasoning, flour and vegetable stock.
. Grease a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. 
. Cover the bottom of the pan evenly with a layer of zucchini rounds, then top with a layer of potato rounds.
. Place the chopped onion in a single even layer on top of the potatoes.
. Create an additional layer of zucchini rounds, then another layer of potato rounds.
. Press down with the palms of your hands to compact the layers.
. Spread the cheese and flour mixture evenly over the top.
. Place on a baking sheet and tent with a sheet of aluminum foil.
. Bake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. If the boureki appears too dry during baking, you can add up to 1/4 cup more vegetable stock, but be cautious as the zucchini and potatoes will release liquid during baking.
. Allow the boureki to cool for 15 minutes before cutting into portions.
