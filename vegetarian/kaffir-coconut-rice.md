## Ingredients
- 1 cup white jasmine rice
- 2 cups vegetable stock
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, ground
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted

## Instructions
1. Rinse the white rice under cold water until the water runs clear, then drain.
2. Add the rinsed rice to your rice cooker.
3. Pour in 1 1/4 cups of water and 1/2 cup of coconut milk.
4. Add the ground kaffir lime leaves and salt to the rice cooker, stirring gently to combine.
5. Close the lid and set your rice cooker to the "whole grain" setting.
6. While the rice is cooking, toast the shredded coconut in a dry pan over medium heat until golden and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Stir constantly to prevent burning, then set aside.
7. Once the rice cooker finishes, let it sit for about 5 minutes with the lid on.
8. Open the rice cooker, remove the kaffir lime leaves, and gently fluff the rice with a fork.
9. Transfer the rice to a serving bowl and sprinkle the toasted coconut on top before serving.

Enjoy this fragrant and flavorful rice as a side dish for your curry!
