== Ingredients
* 1 cup Basmati rice (rinse thoroughly under cold water)
* 2 cups water
* 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or ghee
* 1 crushed Kashmiri chili
* Zest of 1 lime
* Juice of 1 lime
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
* Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

== Method
. Rinse the Rice: Rinse the Basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch and keeps the rice grains separate after cooking.
. Prepare the Seasoning:
.. In a small pan, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat.
.. Add the crushed Kashmiri chili and sauté for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
.. Add the turmeric powder and sauté for another 30 seconds.
.. Remove from heat and set aside.
. Cooking the Rice:
.. Add the rinsed Basmati rice to the rice cooker.
.. Pour in the 2 cups of water, and add the salt.
.. Pour the chili oil mixture over the rice.
.. Add the lime zest and lime juice.
.. Stir gently to mix all the ingredients evenly.
. Select the Cooking Setting: 
.. If you are using white Basmati rice, select the "White Rice" setting on your rice cooker. If using brown Basmati rice, select the "Brown Rice" setting. Note that the cooking time will be longer for brown rice.
. Cook the Rice: Start the rice cooker. Once the rice is cooked, let it sit for 5 minutes with the lid on before fluffing it with a fork.
. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves before serving.
