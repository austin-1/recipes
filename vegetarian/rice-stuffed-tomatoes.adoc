This Stuffed Tomatoes and Rice recipe features juicy tomatoes filled with a savory mixture of bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and seasonings, baked until golden and served over a bed of rice. It's a perfect side dish for holiday dinners, complementing turkey or ham beautifully.

== Ingredients
* 8 medium-sized tomatoes
* 1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs
* 2 tbsp butter, melted
* 2 tsp grated Parmesan cheese
* 1 tsp dried basil
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp dried parsley
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 2 bags Arborio rice, cooked according to package directions

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
. Cut the tops off the tomatoes and scoop out 2-3 spoonfuls of flesh from each. Place the prepared tomatoes on a cookie sheet and set aside.
. In a medium bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, melted butter, Parmesan cheese, basil, oregano, parsley, salt, and pepper.
. Evenly spoon the bread crumb mixture into the hollowed tomatoes, packing it down to fill each tomato as much as possible.
. Bake the stuffed tomatoes for 25 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft and juicy, and the bread crumb topping is golden brown.
. Serve by spooning the cooked rice onto a serving dish and placing the baked tomatoes on top. Serve immediately and refrigerate any leftovers.
