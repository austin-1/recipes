With layers of cheese, tomato sauce, and vegetables, this easy Zucchini Lasagna will soon become a favorite in your house. Low-carb and gluten-free, it is prepared with zucchini slices instead of traditional noodles.

== Ingredients
* 4–5 medium zucchinis, thinly sliced lengthwise
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced
* 3 cups (650g) tomato sauce
* 2 cups (450g) mozzarella cheese, grated
* 1 1/2 cup (375g) ricotta cheese
* 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, grated + extra for topping
* 1 egg
* 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
* Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
* 3 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, chopped + extra for serving

== Instructions
. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
. Slice the zucchinis lengthwise into thin layers using a knife or a mandoline slicer. Arrange the slices onto the prepared baking sheet and brush lightly with olive oil on one side. Pre-bake for about 10 minutes, turning once halfway through cooking. The zucchini slices should be softened but not too greasy. Pat dry with a paper towel to remove excess oil if needed. Set aside.
. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until soft and translucent. Pour in the tomato sauce and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for a few minutes.
. In a medium-sized bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, Parmesan, egg, minced garlic, and 3 tablespoons of chopped basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper.
. Grease a large 13×9-inch baking dish with olive oil. Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce at the bottom of the dish. Layer with zucchini slices, spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture, and sprinkle grated mozzarella. Pour some tomato sauce over the layers and repeat the process until all ingredients are used. Finish with a layer of tomato sauce, grated mozzarella, and extra grated Parmesan on top.
. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Broil on high for a few extra minutes, watching closely to ensure the top is browned but not burned.
. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with additional fresh basil leaves, and serve.
