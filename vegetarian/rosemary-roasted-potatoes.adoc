* 2 pounds Yukon Gold or red potatoes, washed and cut into bite-sized pieces
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* Salt and pepper, to taste

== Instructions
. Prepare the Potatoes:
.. Wash and cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces.

. Coat with Olive Oil:
.. In a large bowl, toss the potato pieces with olive oil until evenly coated.

. Add Rosemary and Garlic:
.. Sprinkle the chopped rosemary and minced garlic over the potatoes. Toss to distribute the herbs and garlic evenly.

. Preheat the Air Fryer:
.. Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C) for a few minutes.

. Check for Doneness:
.. Check for doneness by inserting a fork into a potato piece. They should be golden brown and crispy on the edges.

. Serve:
.. Once the potatoes are done, transfer them to a serving dish and serve hot.
