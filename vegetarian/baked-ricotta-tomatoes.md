# Baked Ricotta & Tomatoes with Thyme Butter

This simple and addictive baked ricotta dip is best enjoyed warm with crackers, toast, or veggies, making it a perfect appetizer for any gathering.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb (455 g) whole-milk ricotta
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 egg
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp fresh thyme leaves, plus 1 tsp chopped
- Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 5 oz (140 g) cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease a 9-in (23-cm) round baking pan or pie pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the ricotta, honey, egg, garlic, 1 tsp thyme leaves, ½ tsp salt, and ½ tsp pepper.
3. Spread the ricotta mixture evenly into the prepared pan and gently press the cherry tomatoes, cut sides down, into the mixture.
4. Bake for 30 minutes and then place the butter directly on top of the ricotta and let it melt for 30 seconds. Once melted, tilt the pan to coat the ricotta with the melted butter and continue baking for 10 minutes more.
5. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the chopped thyme and a little more pepper. Serve warm.
