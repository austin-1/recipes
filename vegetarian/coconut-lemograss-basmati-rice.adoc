= Summer Coastal Thai Coconut Lemongrass Basmati Rice
This light and aromatic basmati rice dish pairs perfectly with seafood curries, bringing the flavors of Thai cuisine to your table.

== Ingredients
* 1 cup basmati rice
* 1 cup coconut milk (unsweetened)
* 1 cup water
* 1 teaspoon lemongrass powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 kaffir lime leaves (optional, for added aroma)
* Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)

== Instructions
. Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear to remove excess starch and prevent the rice from becoming sticky.
. In a rice cooker, add the rinsed rice, coconut milk, water, lemongrass powder, and salt. Stir gently to combine.
. If using kaffir lime leaves, lightly crush them to release their aroma and place them on top of the rice mixture.
. Close the rice cooker lid and select the White Rice setting (or the equivalent cooking setting for white rice).
. Once the rice cooker finishes, allow the rice to rest for 5-10 minutes on the Keep Warm setting to let the flavors meld.
. Open the lid, remove the kaffir lime leaves (if used), and fluff the rice with a fork.
. Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.

Tips::
* To enhance the coconut flavor, you can substitute some or all of the water with additional coconut milk.
* For a slightly more citrusy flavor, add a teaspoon of lime juice before serving.
