== Ingredients
* 12 large portobello mushrooms, stemmed and gills removed
* 6 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
* Sea salt (preferably gray salt) and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
* 1 cup fresh bread crumbs
* 1 cup grated Parmesan
* 4 tablespoons freshly chopped parsley leaves
* 4 tablespoons freshly chopped basil leaves
* 12 (1/2-inch) slices fresh mozzarella, roughly 1 to 1 1/2-ounces per slice

== Directions
. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
. Toss the portobello mushrooms in the balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup of the olive oil, sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Arrange the mushrooms on a baking sheet and roast in the oven for about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.
. While the mushrooms are cooling, mix together the bread crumbs, grated Parmesan, freshly chopped parsley, freshly chopped basil, and the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil in a bowl.
. Place 1 slice (or 2 slices if the mushrooms are large) of mozzarella in the cupped side of each mushroom.
. Distribute the bread and herb mixture evenly over the mushrooms and return them to the oven to roast for 5-6 minutes, or until the mozzarella is molten and the bread and herb topping is a nice golden brown.
. Serve the stuffed portobellos hot or at room temperature. Enjoy!
