== Ingredients

=== Dough
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 tsp salt

=== Filling
* 1 cup finely chopped mushrooms
* 1 cup finely chopped spinach
* 1/2 cup finely chopped onions
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup crumbled sulguni or feta cheese
* 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
* 2 tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* Salt and black pepper to taste

== Instructions
. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water while mixing until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.
. In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, and saut√© until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and become tender, about 5-7 minutes.
. Add the spinach to the skillet and cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
. In a large bowl, combine the mushroom and spinach mixture with the crumbled cheese, dill, cilantro, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to combine.
. Divide the dough into small, equal-sized pieces (about the size of a walnut). Roll each piece into a thin circle on a floured surface.
. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each dough circle. Gather the edges of the dough together, pinching and twisting to seal the dumpling.
. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the dumplings in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Cook for 7-10 minutes, or until the dumplings float to the surface and the dough is cooked through.
. Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and transfer to a serving dish. Serve hot with a sprinkle of fresh herbs and a side of yogurt or sour cream, if desired.
