= Arroz con Gandules (Puerto Rican Rice)
Arroz con Gandules, also known as Puerto Rican Rice with Pigeon Peas, is a traditional and flavorful dish often served during special occasions. If pigeon peas are unavailable, regular peas can be used as a substitute.

== Ingredients
* 3 cups medium or long grain white rice, rinsed
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 2 heaping tablespoons sofrito
* 4 ounces tomato sauce
* 1 can (15 ounces) gandules (pigeon peas), partially drained (or regular peas as a substitute)
* 2 heaping tablespoons alcaparrado
* 1 packet Sazón with Achiote (I use Goya brand)
* 1/2 packet ham flavoring (Goya brand Jamón)
* 1 teaspoon adobo
* 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon ground oregano
* Salt and pepper to taste (start with 2 teaspoons of salt)
* 4-6 cups hot water

== Instructions

. Rinse the rice well in water and set aside.

. In a medium caldero or large pot (about 6 quarts), heat the oil and sauté the sofrito until softened.

. Add the tomato sauce and simmer for 2 minutes.

. Stir in the gandules (or regular peas), alcaparrado, all of the spices, and 4 cups of hot water. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding additional salt 1 teaspoon at a time. The broth should be heavily seasoned and slightly salty.

. Bring the mixture to a rapid boil, then add the rice and stir. Add more water if needed to ensure the rice is covered by 1 inch of water. Reduce the heat to a soft boil and let most of the liquid absorb and evaporate, stirring occasionally and gently to prevent the rice from becoming gummy.

. Carefully mound the rice towards the center of the pot, top with foil, and cover with the lid. Reduce the heat to simmer and cook for 20 minutes.

. Stir the rice by folding it from the bottom up, but do not disturb the bottom of the pan. Continue cooking for another 20-30 minutes, testing after 20 minutes to see if the rice is tender and cooked through.
