= Zucchini Parmesan Skillet

Perfect for weeknight dinners, this quick and easy skillet side dish delivers family-friendly flavors.

== Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 2 tbsp milk
* 3 zucchini, cut lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices
* 1/2 cup panko bread crumbs
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 2 cups strained puréed tomatoes (passata)
* 2 tbsp sautéed onion base
* 1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh basil, divided
* 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

== Instructions
. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk. Dip the zucchini slices into the egg mixture, then toss them in the panko bread crumbs to coat evenly.
. Preheat the broiler to high. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded zucchini slices for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until softened and lightly browned. Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and let cool slightly.
. In a small saucepan, combine the strained tomatoes and sautéed onion base. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the sauce is slightly thickened. Stir in half of the sliced basil.
. Roll up each zucchini slice and place them in a single layer in a cast iron skillet. Spoon the sauce over the top of the rolled zucchini, then sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.
. Broil in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the cheese melts and turns golden. Sprinkle with the remaining fresh basil before serving.
