## Ingredients

### Crescent Roll Dough
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/4 cup warm water
- 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg

### Filling
- 4 cups zucchini, thinly sliced and unpeeled
- 1 cup onion, coarsely chopped
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter or margarine
- 2 teaspoons Dijon or prepared mustard
- 2 eggs, well beaten
- 1 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or 2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes)
- 2 cups shredded cheese (1 cup Muenster or Mozzarella, 1 cup smoked gouda)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon sweet basil leaves
- 1/2 teaspoon oregano leaves
- 1 teaspoon BBQ seasoning

## Instructions

### Making the Crescent Roll Dough
1. In a small bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes until frothy.
2. In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and cut into the flour using a pastry blender or fork until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Add the yeast mixture, milk, and egg to the flour mixture. Mix until the dough comes together. Knead for about 5 minutes until smooth.
4. Cover the dough and let it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.

### Preparing the Filling
1. Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C).
2. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the zucchini and onion, cooking until tender, about 10 minutes.
3. Stir in parsley, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, basil, oregano, and BBQ seasoning. Remove from heat.
4. In a large bowl, combine the beaten eggs and the shredded cheeses. Mix in the cooked vegetable mixture.

### Assembling the Pie
1. Roll out the crescent roll dough on a lightly floured surface into a large circle or rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
2. Press the dough into an 11-inch quiche pan, 10-inch pie pan, or a 12x8-inch baking dish, covering the bottom and sides to form the crust.
3. Spread the mustard evenly over the crust.
4. Pour the vegetable and cheese mixture into the crust, spreading it evenly.

### Baking
1. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean. If the crust begins to brown too much, cover with foil during the last 10 minutes of baking.
2. Remove from the oven and let the pie stand for 10 minutes before serving.

### Serving
- Cut into wedges and serve hot.

### Tips
- If using a 12x8-inch baking dish, shape the dough into 2 long rectangles and press over the bottom and 1-inch up the sides to form the crust.
- To reheat, cover loosely with foil and heat at 375째F (190째C) for 12-15 minutes.
