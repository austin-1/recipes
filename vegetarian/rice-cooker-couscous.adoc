* 1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)
* 1/4 teaspoon ground coriander (optional)
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)
* 1/4 cup toasted slivered almonds (optional, for garnish)

== Instructions
. Ensure the rice cooker is clean and set it to the "white rice" setting.
. In the rice cooker bowl, combine couscous, chicken or vegetable broth, olive oil, salt, ground cumin, and ground coriander.
. Close the lid and start the rice cooker on the "white rice" setting, allowing it to complete the cooking cycle.
. Once the rice cooker switches to the "keep warm" setting, open the lid and fluff the couscous with a fork, ensuring all the liquid has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. If needed, let it sit for a few more minutes on the "keep warm" setting.
. Transfer the couscous to a serving dish and garnish with chopped fresh parsley, toasted slivered almonds, and raisins or dried apricots if desired.
