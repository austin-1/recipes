== Ingredients
* 2 Bartlett pears
* 1/2 tsp lemon juice
* 3 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon brown sugar
* 1/2 cup honey
* 2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* Pinch of nutmeg
* 1 pound fresh pumpkin, peeled, seeded, and diced (about 2 cups)
* 1 medium acorn squash, peeled, seeded, and diced (about 2 cups)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 4 eggs
* 1 cup heavy cream

== Instructions
. Prepare the Pears:
.. Core and cut one pear into thin slices. Layer the slices in salted paper towels to draw out moisture.
.. Core, peel, and dice the other pear and mix with the diced acorn squash, pumpkin, and 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.

. Preheat the Oven:
.. Preheat your oven to 325째F (163째C). Butter a casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of butter.

. Make the Honey Spice Mixture:
.. In a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
.. Once the mixture begins to brown, fold in the honey, grated ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix well and set aside.

. Assemble the Gratin:
.. Place a layer of the pumpkin, squash, and diced pear mixture in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish. Press it down compactly.
.. Brush the layer with the hot honey mixture.
.. Repeat the layering process until the dish is three-fourths filled, pressing down each layer compactly and brushing with the honey mixture.
.. Pierce through the layers with a fork in several locations.

. Make the Custard:
.. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the eggs and add the heavy cream, whipping until well blended. Season with salt and pepper and add any remaining honey mixture.
.. Pour the custard over the layered gratin and top with the reserved pear slices.

. Bake the Gratin:
.. Place the gratin inside a larger pan and add water to halfway up the side of the gratin dish.
.. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean and the custard is set.
.. Raise the oven heat to 425째F (218째C) and bake for an additional 10 minutes to lightly brown the top.

. Cool and Serve:
.. Remove the gratin from the oven and allow it to cool completely before refrigerating. Reheat before serving.
