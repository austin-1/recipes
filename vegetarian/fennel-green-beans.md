# Turkish Braised Fennel and Green Beans

A light and flavorful Turkish dish that combines tender fennel and green beans in a rich tomato sauce, perfect for balancing the creamy curry. This recipe cooks beautifully in a 2-cup Handi pot alongside your curry.

## Ingredients
- 1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and sliced into 1/4-inch wedges
- 1/2 cup green beans, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
- 1/4 cup onion, finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup diced tomatoes (canned or fresh)
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth or water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of half a lemon
- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and place the empty Handi pot in the oven to preheat as well.
2. Heat the olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat on the stove.
3. Add the chopped onion and sauté until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
4. Add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
5. Add the fennel wedges and green beans to the pan, stirring to coat them with the oil, onion, and garlic. Cook for 3-4 minutes until the vegetables start to soften.
6. Pour in the diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, and sugar. Stir well to combine, then bring the mixture to a simmer.
7. Carefully remove the preheated Handi pot from the oven (using oven mitts), and transfer the mixture from the pan into the Handi pot.
8. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover with the lid, and return the Handi pot to the oven.
9. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the fennel and green beans are tender and the sauce has thickened.
10. Remove from the oven, squeeze over the lemon juice, and garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
