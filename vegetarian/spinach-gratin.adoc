A rich and comforting side dish, Creamy Spinach Gratin combines fresh spinach with a luscious cream sauce and a golden, cheesy topping. Perfect for special occasions or as a decadent addition to your meal.

== Ingredients
- 2 pounds fresh spinach, washed and trimmed
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for topping)

== Instructions
. Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a baking dish with butter or cooking spray.
. Blanch the Spinach: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spinach and blanch for about 1-2 minutes until wilted. Drain the spinach and squeeze out excess water. Chop the spinach coarsely.
. Make the Cream Sauce: In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the chopped onion and garlic, cooking until softened.
. Add Flour and Create Roux: Sprinkle the flour over the onion and garlic mixture, stirring constantly to form a smooth paste (roux). Cook for 1-2 minutes to eliminate the raw flour taste.
. Add Milk and Cream: Gradually whisk in the milk and heavy cream to the roux, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens.
. Season and Add Cheese: Stir in the nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Add the grated Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses, and continue stirring until the cheeses are melted and the sauce is smooth.
. Combine Spinach and Sauce: Add the chopped spinach to the cream sauce, mixing until the spinach is evenly coated.
. Transfer to Baking Dish: Transfer the creamy spinach mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it out evenly.
. Optional Breadcrumb Topping: If desired, sprinkle breadcrumbs evenly over the top for a crunchy topping.
. Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes or until the top is golden brown and the gratin is bubbling.
. Serve: Allow the gratin to cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm as a delightful side dish.
