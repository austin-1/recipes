== Ingredients
* 4 large russet potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 3 hard-boiled eggs, chopped
* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 1/4 cup yellow mustard
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons sugar
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 1 celery stalk, finely chopped
* 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish
* 1 teaspoon celery seed
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)

* Paprika for garnish (optional)

== Instructions
. Cook the Potatoes:
.. Place the cubed potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Add a pinch of salt to the water.
.. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 10-12 minutes.
.. Drain the potatoes and set aside to cool.

. Prepare the Dressing:
.. In a large mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yellow mustard, apple cider vinegar, and sugar. Whisk until smooth and well combined.

. Mix the Salad:
.. Add the cooled potatoes, chopped eggs, finely chopped onion, celery, and sweet pickle relish to the dressing.
.. Sprinkle in the celery seed, salt, and black pepper.
.. Gently toss everything together until the potatoes and vegetables are evenly coated with the dressing.

. Chill and Serve:
.. Cover the potato salad and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until well chilled. This allows the flavors to meld together.
.. Before serving, garnish with a sprinkle of paprika if desired.
