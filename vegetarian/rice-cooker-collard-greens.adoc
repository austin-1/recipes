== Ingredients
* 1 bunch collard greens, washed and chopped
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 smoked ham hock, or 1/4 cup diced smoked bacon (optional)
* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
* 1 tbsp olive oil or butter

== Method
. Prepare the Collard Greens:
. Remove the tough stems from the collard greens and chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces.

. Sauté the Aromatics:
. In a separate pan on the stove, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.
. Add the chopped onion and garlic to the pan and sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onions are translucent.

. Cook the Ham (Optional):
. If using a smoked ham hock, place it in the pan to brown slightly. Alternatively, if using diced bacon or ham, sauté until slightly browned.

. Combine and Cook in the Rice Cooker:
. Transfer the sautéed aromatics and ham hock (or bacon/ham) into the rice cooker.
. Add the chopped collard greens, stirring to combine.
. Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth, and add the apple cider vinegar, sugar, crushed red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and black pepper.
. Close the rice cooker lid and set it to the "brown rice" setting. Allow the collard greens to cook through one complete cycle.

. Finish and Serve:
. Once the rice cooker completes its cycle, check the tenderness of the collard greens. If they need more time, you can start another cycle or switch to the "keep warm" setting until they reach your desired tenderness.

== Notes

* When cooking collard greens in a rice cooker, be aware that the greens release moisture during cooking, which may cause the rice cooker's humidity-sensing timer to stall around the 10-minute mark. 
* Allow up to an extra 30 minutes of cooking time for the collard greens to fully cook and for all the excess water to evaporate. 
* If necessary, you can manually restart the cooking cycle or switch to the "keep warm" setting until the greens reach your desired tenderness.
